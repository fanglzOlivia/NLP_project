Service:  Cardiothoracic

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old female patient who had a very prolonged previous hospitalization at the [**Hospital1 69**] and was ultimately discharged on [**2195-5-28**].  During her hospitalization, she underwent coronary artery bypass graft x4 with an aortic valve replacement.  Her postoperative course was complicated by aspiration, wound infection of her sternal wound as well as of her saphenectomy, gastrostomy tube placement, followed by necrosis of the abdominal wall as well as acute renal failure.  Please see discharge summary from that hospitalization for details of her postoperative course after her cardiac surgery.

The patient was readmitted to the hospital on [**2195-6-6**] due to fevers to 103 at the rehabilitation facility despite being on intravenous antibiotics.  In the Emergency Department, the patient was noted to have a fair amount of purulent drainage in the open sternal wound.  The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at that time.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft as previously noted with an aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis. 2. End-stage renal disease.  The patient is hemodialysis dependent. 3. Hypertension. 4. Insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus. 5. Sleep apnea. 6. Vertigo. 7. Osteoarthritis. 8. Skin cancer in the past. 9. Abdominal hernia repair. 10. Uterine cancer status post total abdominal hysterectomy. 11. Obesity.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL: 1. Tobramycin. 2. Vancomycin. 3. Reglan. 4. Protonix. 5. Amiodarone. 6. Zoloft. 7. Compazine.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL:  The patient was awake and responsive, following commands appropriately.  She was on a ventilator via tracheostomy. HEENT was unremarkable.  Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Patient was tachycardic with a regular, rate, and rhythm.  Her abdomen was soft, obese, nontender, and nondistended.

LABORATORY VALUES UPON ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL:  White blood cell count of 10,000, hematocrit of 32, platelet count of 201.  Sodium of 148, potassium 3.3, chloride 110, CO2 21, BUN 42, creatinine 3.7, glucose of 277.

Patient initially had an echocardiogram which revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60% and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.

Chest x-ray on admission to the hospital revealed a small left pleural effusion, and questionable congestive heart failure pattern.

It was noted that the patient's Vancomycin and tobramycin levels were quite low upon admission to the hospital, and she was restarted on both of those medications.

On [**6-7**], hospital day two, the patient underwent a Plastic Surgery consultation due to persistent sternal wound infection, which had previously been healing now showing signs of infection.  Patient was also noted to have Clostridium difficile colitis, for which she had been placed on intravenous Flagyl.

The patient was ultimately taken to the operating room on [**2195-6-9**] after transesophageal echocardiogram the previous day ruled out endocarditis.  In the operating room the patient underwent a limited sternal wound debridement and drainage of some fluids at the inferior portion of her wound.

Postoperatively, the patient returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, where she has had problems with intermittent hypotension requiring IV Neo-Synephrine drip. Patient continued on tube feeds via her jejunostomy tube which was previously placed during her previous admission, which she had been tolerating well.  She was still on the ventilator on varying levels of pressure support in the CPAP mode which she had tolerated well on 50% FIO2.

Patient received a few units of packed red blood cells over the course of the next few days due to drifting hematocrit. Patient's sternal wound had remained clean, and ultimately a VAC dressing was placed in the sternal wound area on [**2195-6-18**].  The patient was maintained on 3x a week hemodialysis treatments on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and has been tolerating those treatments well.  Patient's pressure support was ultimately weaned from 12 to 5, and she has remained on pressure support of 5 for the past few days with an FIO2 of 50% and a PEEP of 5 as well, and has remained stable on those ventilator settings.

The patient has had short bouts of trache mask trials, but does get tachypneic after approximately 30 minutes.  Patient also required bedside repositioning of her jejunostomy tube which was done in the Intensive Care Unit successful with no sequelae from that patient.  The patient has remained with stable hemodynamic parameters.  Has been tolerating her tube feeds, has remained on minimal ventilator supports, and she is ready to be transferred to rehabilitation facility to progress with Physical [**Hospital 966**] rehabilitation, and ultimate weaning from a ventilator.

The patient's condition day on [**2195-6-19**] is as follows: temperature is 99.0, heart rate is 88 in normal sinus rhythm, respiratory rate varies from 18-24.  Her blood pressure is 114/46.  On the ventilator, the patient is in a CPAP mode with 5 of PEEP, 5 of pressure support, and 50% of O2 with a most recent blood gas being 7.41, 41, 73, 27.  Other laboratory values from today, [**6-19**] are as follows:  White blood cell count 5.6, hematocrit of 35.8, platelet count of 206.  PT 13.9, INR 1.3, PTT 29.9, sodium 132, potassium 5.3, chloride 99, CO2 24, BUN 64, creatinine 3.6, glucose 124.

Patient's most recent chest x-ray was on [**2195-6-8**] which showed a chronic left pleural effusion.

Most recent cultures include a sputum culture from [**6-8**] which revealed MRSA, Pseudomonas, as well as Serratia. Patient is previously cultured MRSA from both her leg wound and her sternal wound.  Stool on [**6-10**] is positive for Clostridium difficile.  Urine on [**6-12**] is positive for proteus and enterococcus, and her sternal wound swab on [**6-9**] had rare growth of diphtheroids.

Physical examination today:  The patient is awake, alert, and responsive.  She has coarse breath sounds bilaterally.  Her chest wound is clean with a VAC dressing in place.  Her abdomen is soft, obese, and nontender.  Her extremities are with 2+ edema bilaterally.
