Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1187**] is a 78 year old woman with a PMHx of afib (not on coumadin), DM2, and dementia admitted for HHS with glucose to 1053.

# HHS: Glucose elevated to 1053 on admission with anion gap 25, hemoconcentrated to Hct 54.  Glucose on u/a but no ketones. Although this picture could also be consistent with b-hydroxybutyrate ketoacidosis, the high glucose and type II diabetes history makes HHS more likely. AG could also be secondary lactate elevation from poor perfusion in the setting of volume depletion. AG resolved within 12 hours of IVF. The underlying trigger of her HHS is uncertain. Urinalysis demonstrates 9 WBC and few bacteria (along with 3 epidermal cells). Streaky RLL ifiltrate on CXR was thought unlikely to be pneumonia. Ischemic cardiac event was ruled out with troponins x 4. Considering that she was reported as poorly complaint at her ECF with medications, and refused several medications each day while in the MICU, she likely had an aspect of medical noncompliance either contributing or even causing her HHS. Her non-compliance and/or inadequacy of home diabetes therapy is further bolstered by her A1C of 12. She was started on insulin drip, received 7 L of IV fluids, and then was transitioned to a SQ insulin regimen [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recommendations which included a QACHS insulin sliding scale with humolog and QHS lantus. We held her oral diabetes medication while inpatient. On transfer to the floor from the MICU the patient was stable and her blood sugar was being controlled with SQ insulin regimen. . # UTI: Admission urinalysis concerning for possible UTI, but culture more likely contamination.  Pt asyptomatic.  Received 3-day course of levofloxacin.  Urinalysis demonstrated 9 WBC and few bacteria (along with 3 epidermal cells). Urine culture with 10-100K gram positive cocci concerning for lactobacillus vs. group a strep. [**12-24**] sets of blood cultures were positive for coag negative staph which was thought to be a contaminant. Ms. [**Known lastname 1187**] was treated for her UTI with 3 days of levofloxacin. . # HLD: Simvastatin was continued while Ms. [**Known lastname 1187**] was in house. . # HTN: Atenolol was continued while Ms. [**Known lastname 1187**] was in house. Lisinopril and furosemide were held as patient initially demonstrated pre-renal azotemia with initial creatinine to 1.3 which responded to 0.9 with IVF. . # afib: Ms. [**Known lastname 1187**] was rate controlled while in house with atenolol. Aspirin was started. . Transitional issues: 1. Diabetes. Reportedly poor medication compliance at ECF (patient sometimes hides pills). [**Last Name (un) **] consulted and started on insulin per med list. Please have sugars followed closely. Thus her Metformin and glypizide were stopped.

2. Her lisinopril and furosemide were stopped in the setting of her acute illness. Please start these as you see fit if her blood pressures become elevated as her systolic blood pressure have been in the 110's prior to discharge here and thus we didn't start them.

3. A second round of blood cultures are pending on discharge given coag pos staph in blood culture on admission.
