HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old male referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for evaluation of surgical options for severe aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease.

The patient experienced a near-syncopal episode in [**2124-1-8**]; for which she was evaluated at [**Hospital 1048**] [**Hospital 1049**] Hospital. As part of his workup, the patient received a cardiac catheterization which subsequently demonstrated severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.78 cm2 and mild grade [**12-11**] aortic insufficiency.  In addition, the patient demonstrated 3-vessel disease of the right coronary artery, left anterior descending artery, and circumflex with diffuse 68% stenosis of each.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was subsequently evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and recommended for elective coronary artery bypass graft and aortic valve repair to take place on [**2124-4-24**].

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is retired.  He is married and lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 1051**], [**Name (NI) 108**].  The patient has a past history of smoking but has been abstinent for many years.  The patient denies the use of alcohol or recreational drugs.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**2124-4-24**] the patient underwent a coronary artery bypass graft using a saphenous vein graft and aorta to the right posterior descending artery, as well as an aortic valve repair using a 23-mm CE tissue valve.  The patient tolerated the procedure well with a total bypass time of 139 minutes and a cross-clamp time of 125 minutes.

The patient's pericardium was left open.  Lines placed included an arterial line and a Swan-Ganz catheter.  Both ventricular and atrial wires were placed.  Two mediastinal tubes were placed.  The patient was subsequently transferred intubated to the Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit for further observation and management.

On transfer, the patient had a mean arterial pressure of 62, a central venous pressure of 9, a PAD of 14, and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1052**] of 19. The patient was noted to be in a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 90 beats per minute.  Active drips on transfer included propofol.

In the Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit, the patient was initially noted to be agitated and hypertensive; requiring treatment with a nitroglycerin drip and Haldol for sedation.

On postoperative day two, the patient was successfully weaned and extubated without complications.  Following extubation, the patient was noted to be confused with variable compliance with following commands and variable orientation.  This confusion continued for the duration of his admission with gradual resolution to a level consistent with the patient's baseline level of moderate dementia.

The patient continued to progress well clinically in the Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit with an uneventful transition to a full regular diet and adequate transition to pain control via oral pain medications.

Following successful removal of his chest tubes and pacer wires on postoperative day four, the patient was cleared for transfer to the floor and was subsequently admitted to the Cardiothoracic Service under the direction of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**].

On the floor, the patient continued to progress well clinically to the time of his discharge.  The patient was restarted on his home medications with a notable improvement in his mental status and was also placed on evening Risperidone 0.5 mg with a notable decrease in his nighttime agitation.

On the evening of postoperative day six, the patient sustained a minor fall while agitated; resulting in a small abrasion to his right forearm without other associated injuries.  At no time did the patient sustain any head trauma or loss of consciousness.

On postoperative day seven, the patient's Foley catheter was removed without complications.  He was subsequently noted to be independently productive of adequate amounts of urine for the duration of his stay.

The patient was also evaluated by Physical Therapy who declared the patient a suitable candidate for placement in a rehabilitation facility following resolution of his acute medical issues.  Thereafter, the patient was screened by a rehabilitation facility and subsequently cleared for discharge to an extended care facility on postoperative day nine ([**2124-5-3**]) with instructions for followup.
