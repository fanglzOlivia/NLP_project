Lower extremity exam is antigravity but effort dependent. Moves spontaneously, but not always to command. No clonus Sensation reduced below C7 to light touch At discharge she had an episode of hypotension which resolved when in bed to 140/55. According to daughter in law the patient is always hypotensive baseline.



Pertinent Results: MR C/T/L spine [**2113-4-28**]: IMPRESSION: 1. Edema within the spinal cord at C5-C7, likely due to contusion secondary to spinal stenosis and trauma with blood products within the cord consistent with hemorrhagic contusion. 2. Posterior disc bulge and osteophyte complex at multiple levels, most severe at C5-C6 with moderate neural foraminal narrowing bilaterally at C5-C6 as well as moderate posterior disc bulge and osteophyte formation at C4-C5 and C6-C7 level with mild neural foraminal stenosis bilaterally at these levels. 3. Multilevel degenerative changes within the lumbar spine, most prominent at C4-C5 with disc bulge and facet degenerative changes causing minimal narrowing of the spinal cord and indentation of the thecal sac. 4. Posterior soft tissue swelling with no obvious disruption of the ligamentum flavum, anterior, posterior spinous ligaments within the cervical region.Increased signal in interspinous region without widening of interspinous distance indicates trauma without disruption.

ECHO [**2113-4-29**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

Head CT [**2113-4-29**]: No evidence of SAH.

EEG [**2113-4-30**]: Normal

Carotid Ultrasound [**2113-5-2**]: Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid arteries. On the right there is moderate heterogeneous plaque in the bulb/ICA. On the left there is moderate heterogeneous plaque seen in the bulb/ICA.

On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA proximal, mid and distal respectively are 76/21, 56/10, 79/17 cm/sec. CCA peak systolic velocity is 52 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 100 cm/sec. The ICA/CCA ratio is 1.5. These findings are consistent with <40% stenosis.

On the left systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA proximal, mid and distal respectively are 75/20, 85/18, 72/16 cm/sec. CCA peak systolic velocity is 54 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 67 cm/sec. The ICA/CCA ratio is 1.6. These findings are consistent with <40% stenosis.

Right antegrade vertebral artery flow. Left antegrade vertebral artery flow.

Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA stenosis <40%.

 Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 931**] was admitted on [**2113-4-28**] after sustaining a C5-6 cord contusion and SAH after a syncope fall at home. She was admitted to the ICU for close observation where her blood pressure was kept to a MAP of 85 for perfusion. She was placed in a hard cervical collar. On [**2113-4-29**] the trauma service cleared her T and L spine. Repeat head CT was stable and she was transferred to the floor.

Syncope workup:  ECHO was negative  Carotid ultrasound (see report)  EEG was normal  Hgb A1c 5.9

PT/OT worked with the patient and recommended rehab placement.

On [**2113-5-3**] she was discharged to [**Hospital 38**] Rehab

 Discharge Instructions: ??????	No pulling up, lifting more than 15 lbs., or excessive bending or twisting until your follow-up appointment ??????	Limit your use of stairs to 2-3 times per day. ??????	If you are required to wear one, wear your cervical collar or back brace as instructed. ??????	Please shower with the cervical collar on. You may remove the brace off briefly to provide skin care. ??????	Take your pain medication as instructed; you may find it best if taken in the morning when you wake-up for morning stiffness, and before bed for sleeping discomfort. ??????	Do not take any anti-inflammatory medications such as Motrin, Advil, Aspirin, and Ibuprofen etc. unless directed by your doctor. ??????	Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as pain medicine (narcotics) can cause constipation. We recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication. ??????	You [**Month (only) **] NOT drive as you are required to wear a cervical collar. Return to work recommendations will be discussed at your office visit. ??????	Exercise should be limited to walking; no straining, or excessive bending. ??????	If you were on a medication such as Coumadin (Warfarin), or Plavix (clopidogrel), or Aspirin prior to your injury, please refrain from taking until cleared by your Neurosurgeon- this will occur at your follow-up appointment

 Followup Instructions: Please have your occipital sutures removed on [**2113-5-8**]. You may have this done with your PCP or with our clinic. Please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1272**] to make this appointment.

Please follow-up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] in [**1-5**] weeks. You will not need spinal imaging at that time, but you will need a Head CT to reassess your head bleed. Please call Paresa to make this appointment [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1272**].
