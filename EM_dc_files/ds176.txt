Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1146**] was initially treated for a COPD exacerbation, which was felt to be the primary contributor to her SOB especially given that she wasn't on any inhalers at home despite an FEV1 of 25% predicted in [**2095**].  She was also ruled out for MI.  Her creatinine initially trended down with gentle hydration.  On the evening of [**2108-2-18**], she was found to be in Afib w/RVR to the 150s.  She was given metoprolol 5 mg IV x3 and diltiazem x 1 dose without successful slowing.  She became more tachypneic and short of breath, and hypotensive to the 70s.  She was intubated, cardioverted to NSR w/100 Jx1, and started on dopamine.  She was transferred to the CCU.  Overnight, she went back into afib w/RVR and required cardioversion twice (second time successful at 200J).  She was only in NSR for a short time, and again went back into afib.   She was bolused w/amiodarone 150 mg and begun on an amio infusion at 1 mg/min.  Cardioversion was again briefly successful but she ultimately went back into afib.  Her dopamine was weaned off on [**2-19**].  Her rhythm was in and out of afib but eventually converted to sinus with the amio infusion. She had a TTE which revealed an EF 30-35%, repeat CXR c/w worsening failure, and diuresis was attempted with a lasix gtt. Her vent was changed from AC to PS but she became progressively acidemic (ABG from 7.42/42/92 to 7.21/56/66).  Her creatinine began to increase with the attempt at diuresis, from 1.0 to 1.5.  At this point she also developed a cold/purple R foot, and a heparin gtt was started.  This resolved the problem.  Vascular surgery evaluated the pt and agreed with this treatment. Because of her severe COPD, it was felt that it would be very difficult to wean her from the vent.  At that point, there was a discussion between the PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1147**] and the family, who felt it was best to extubate her and keep her comfortable.  She was then extubated at that time and given morphine for comfort. She died at 3:15 pm on [**2108-2-22**] with her family by her side.
