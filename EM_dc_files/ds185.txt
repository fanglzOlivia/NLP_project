Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1. Exploratory laparotomy. 2. Exploration of retroperitoneum. 3. Open cholecystectomy. 4. Venting decompressed colotomy. 5. J-tube placement.

 History of Present Illness: This 48-year-old [**First Name3 (LF) 1229**] has mental retardation and a seizure syndrome. He presents to our emergency room acutely with reports of [**1-15**] days of abdominal pain as described by his caretakers, who find him grimacing in an umbilical position. He had a change in bowel habits and decreased PO intake for 2 weeks. He is largely unresponsive and he responds only to keep the stimulation for pain. He has had fevers for the last few days, up as high as 104 degrees. A workup was performed for this, and initial imaging of the abdomen showed multiple views consistent with a free air in the abdomen. This with a lactic acidosis, distended abdomen and a neutrophilia band shift, along with the after mentioned history was very concerning for an acute process which required an emergent operation. This was especially so given the fact that we could not adequately communicate with this [**Name2 (NI) 1229**] and did not know the full extent of his recognition of pain due to his mental retardation.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2164-5-4**] 7:25 PM PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST, ONE VIEW: Heart size is normal. There is a mild hilar prominence, with patchy areas of airspace opacities bilaterally. Given the history of prolonged seizure, these may represent areas of aspiration. There is no pneumothorax. There is no pleural effusion. There is a massive amount of free intraperitoneal air, with free air seen underneath both hemidiaphragms. Osseous structures are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. Massive amount of pneumoperitoneum. 2. Multifocal patchy areas of airspace opacity, likely represents aspiration, and possible superimposed neurogenic pulmonary edema. . CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2164-5-5**] 4:07 PM Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. Cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged. Diffuse airspace opacities, worse on the right side, are unchanged. There are no new lung abnormalities. As mentioned before, these are suspicious for aspiration. There are no increasing pleural effusions. . CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2164-5-8**] 8:07 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-5**], there has been some decrease in the still substantial bilateral pulmonary opacifications, suspicious for aspiration. .

Reason: new NGT

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 48 year old man s/p ccy REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: new NGT HISTORY: New nasogastric tube.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-8**], there has been placement of a nasogastric tube that coils within the fundus of the stomach. The diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacification shows a slow steady decrease. .

ECHO Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis or clinically-significant regurgitant valvular disease. Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function. .

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2164-5-13**] 2:09 PM

IMPRESSION: 1. Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities consistent with bilateral pneumonia with a more focal consolidation in the superior right lower lobe and posterior right upper lobe. Small bilateral pleural effusions. 2. Large hiatal hernia. 3. Marked fecal impaction of the colon to the level of the rectosigmoid. 4. Post-surgical changes in the anterior abdomen. Moderate amount of free fluid in the pelvis, likely post-surgical.

 Brief Hospital Course: This is a 48 year old male with MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] who presented with abdominal pain, fever.

Initial CXR revealed free air in the abdomen. This with a lactic acidosis, distended abdomen and a neutrophilia band shift. This was very concerning for an acute process which required an emergent operation.

He went to the OR on [**2164-5-5**] for: 1. Exploratory laparotomy. 2. Exploration of retroperitoneum. 3. Open cholecystectomy. 4. Venting decompressed colotomy. 5. J-tube placement.

His pain was controlled with IV Morphine. He was NPO with IVF. We awaited return of bowel function. Trophic tube feedings were started. Due to possible silent aspirations, a NGT was placed. The NGT put out a 2L of drainage. The tubefeedings were temporarily held. The NGT was self D/C'd on [**2164-5-9**]. His tubefeedings were restarted and he was tolerating these. A swallow evaluation was done and he was started on pureed solids and thin liquids. He should continue with tubefeedings, these are now cycled. Tube feeds can be weaned as he tolerates better PO's.

Blood loss anemia: His HCT on [**2164-5-10**] was 20.9. He received 2 unit of blood and a repeat HCT was 27.

Micro: He had MRSA blood culture from [**5-7**]. He was treated with Vancomycin for a MRSA PNA. Vanco needs to continue thru [**2164-5-23**].

His incision was C/D/I and staples removed prior to discharge.

Respiratory: He was on nasal cannula. O2 sats dipped to the 80's% with agitation. CXR revealed possible aspiration PNA and RLL infiltrate.

Seizure: Neurology was consulted given his seizure disorder. He was extubated on [**5-5**] and was noted to have one brief seizure since extubation, becoming unresponsive, jerking tonic clonic movement of his UE was noted. At baseline, he has approximately [**1-16**] seizures per month, lasting 1-3 minutes in duration, with a long post-ictal period. At baseline, he is alert and oriented to self. He was restarted on his home meds and ordered for standing Ativan. His goal corrected Dilantin level was >15 given stressors of acute illness, fever. We will taper Ativan slowly and depending on clinical course and frequency of sz. After initially keeping his Dilantin level >15, we then aimed for Dilantin level [**9-26**]. He required occasional Dilantin boluses and his level should be checked at rehab.
