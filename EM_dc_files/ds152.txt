CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2102-4-15**] 10:02 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: s/p removal of chest tubes

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 76 year old woman pod 2 s/p MVR, now s/p chest tube removal REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: s/p removal of chest tubes EXAMINATION: AP chest.

INDICATION: Mitral valve replacement. Status post chest tube removal.

Single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2102-4-15**] at 10:30 hours and compared with the prior radiograph of [**2102-4-13**] at 14:20 hours. Patient has been extubated and chest tubes have been removed as has a right-sided Swan-Ganz catheter. Patient is status post cardiac surgery. Increased retrocardiac density in the left side with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm persists and is consistent with postsurgical atelectasis in the left base. Small left pleural effusion may also be present. In the upper abdomen there is colon interposition on the right side.

Findings LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). [Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mild AS (AoVA 1.2-1.9cm2). No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Severe mitral annular calcification. Eccentric MR jet. Effective regurgitant orifice is >=0.40cm2. MR vena contracta is >=0.7cm Severe (4+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. See Conclusions for post-bypass data The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of medications). Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: 1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] 3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 4. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. 6. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification. An eccentric,anterior directed jet and a central jet are seen The effective regurgitant orifice is >=0.40cm2 The mitral regurgitation vena contracta is >=0.7cm. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 7. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine. 1. A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the mitral position with normal leaflet motion. No mitral regurgitation is seen. 2. Left ventricular systolic function is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is normal. 3. Aorta is intact post decannulation. 4. [**Location (un) 109**] is still mildly decreased with no gradient (Peak of 12 mm of Hg). 4. Other findings are unchanged

 Brief Hospital Course: She was taken to the operating room on [**4-13**] where she underwent a MVR. She was transferred to the ICU in stable condition. She was extubated that night. She was transferred to the floor on POD #2. She was confused intermittently and required a sitter.  Her confusion improved, she otherwise did well postoperatively and was ready for discharge to rehab on POD #4.
