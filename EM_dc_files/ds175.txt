Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1136**] Chief Complaint: hypoglycemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Incision and drainage with resection of first metatarsal [**2195-11-25**] Wound closure [**2195-11-30**]

 History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 1137**] is a 68yo M w/hx of DM2 (A1c [**10-23**] 7.1%), afib on coumadin, chronic diabetic foot ulcers, h/o EtOH abuse, and HTN who was sent in from his PCPs office with symptomatic hypoglycemia to 36 that has been ongoing for 3+ days. FSGs have been 30s-50s, even postprandially. He usually runs in the 130s. No recent changes to hypoglycemics, and states he has been adherent to his meds without overdoses. He states that he is asymptomatic with these sugars, but his wife says he's been sleepier. Per his wife, his diet has been healthier with less sugar recently. In his PCP's office, his FSG went up to 70s with glucose tabs and glucagon. Was also seen by podiatry clinic this AM with non-healing ulcer that requires surgical debridement. Then sent to ER. . In the ED, VS 97.6 68 142/97 18 96% 2L. Exam revealed guaiac negative OB brown stool. Labs showed elevated WBC count of 15.6 with 90%PMNs, elevated INR of 9.5, and hypoglycemia with glucose of 63. Serial glucose monitoring revealed: 12:45 glu 30 -> amp D50. 1:45 gluc 30 -> amp D50. 14:30 gluc 147. 15:30 FSG 19 --> 2 more amps d50. Also got 1L D51/2NS. Also received octreotide 50mcg. Reveived Vanco, cipro, flagyl per podiatry and was put on a CIWA for hx of EtOH withdrawal (did not need any down in ED). Podiatry felt that he will require surgery but deferred given elevated INR. Most recent vitals: afebrile 63 168/45 20 95% 2L.

. Currently, he patient denies nausea/vomiting/lightheadedness, tremulousness, or sweats. He did feel some of these symptoms down in the ER when his sugar was low. He denies recent fevers or chills. He does note that he has been on a new medication, Bactrim, as well as a higher dose of coumadin, since his admission [**Date range (1) 1138**] for fall, hip pain. No new cough, SOB, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. He has been tolerating his po's very well. He notes asymmetric leg swelling which is not new for him. He has had more pain in his foot ulcer and hip (from a fall last week), for which he has been taking oxycodone.

MICROBIOLOGY: [**2195-11-23**] Blood Cx negative [**2195-11-23**] Wound Swab Culture - Presumptive peptostreptococcus [**2195-11-23**] Urine Cx negative [**2195-11-25**] Tissue Culture - rare growth - MSSA [**2195-11-25**] Swab Culture - pan-sensitive Enterococcus [**2195-11-30**] Tissue Cx - Coag negative Staph

STUDIES: [**11-23**] Foot Xray: 1) Sensitivity for osteomyelitis somewhat limited by overlying bandage. 2) Osteopenia, which is worse compared with [**2195-9-23**] and probably slightly worse compared with [**2195-11-14**], but without definite discrete bone destruction. Please see comment.

[**2195-11-24**]: TTE: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-9-25**], a left pleural effusion and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension are now identified.

[**2195-11-25**]: Chest xray: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. On the lateral view, there is substantial bilateral pleural effusion. No evidence of vascular congestion.

[**2195-11-25**] Foot xray: Since the previous study, there has been debridement at the first MTP joint. Cortical irregularity at the base of the first proximal phalanx and of the first metatarsal head is seen. There is gauze material seen at the surgical site. There are prominent spurs about the calcaneal tuberosity. There is a lot of soft tissue swelling. Please refer to the operative note for additional details.

[**2195-11-30**] Foot XR - There appears to have been resection of the distal first metatarsal and base of the first proximal phalanx. There is an overlying skin defect and associated subcutaneous emphysema. Direct comparison to the [**2195-11-25**] films is limited due to overlying bandage, but the bone resection is new compared with [**2195-11-23**]. No other areas of focal osteolysis are identified at this time.

PATHOLOGY: [**2195-11-25**] 1.  Sesamoid, left foot (A): -  Trabecular bone fragments with marrow fibrosis, acute osteomyelitis and osteonecrosis. - Hyaline cartilage with focal acute inflammation. 2.  Bone, left first metatarsal head (B-C): -  Trabecular bone with marrow fibrosis, acute osteomyelitis and osteonecrosis. -  Hyaline cartilage with focal acute inflammation. 3.  Bone, base of hallux left foot (D): -  Trabecular bone with focal osteonecrosis, acute inflammation, marrow fibrosis, and extensive remodelling. -  Hyaline cartilage with focal acute inflammation.

[**2195-11-30**] Left foot, proximal phalanx, excision (A): - Markedly reactive bone with acute inflammation. [**2195-11-30**] Left foot, clearing fragment, excision (B): -   Bone with marked reactive changes.



Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo man with type 2 diabetes melitus, atrial fibrilation, and chronic left foot osteomyelitis with cellulitis was admitted with hypoglycemia and bradycardia.

1. Hypoglycemia: He was initially admitted to the ICU given persistent hypoglycemia in the setting of recent bactrim use with glipizide, which was thought to prolong the effects of the glipizide. He required D50 boluses and an octreotide drip with D10 in the ICU to maintain his blood sugar. His blood sugar improved from 30's to 300's and the octreotide drip and D10 drip were stopped. After his multiple podiatric procedures were performed, his oral hypoglycemics were restarted and his blood sugars remained stable between 80-200.

2. Bradycardia: Noted on admission, thought secondary to elevated digoxin level and interaction with bactrim. His digoxin and verapamil were initially held. They were then both restarted once his many procedures were completed, and his heart rate remained between 60-80s.

3. Left osteomyelitis and cellulitis: He was treated with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and flagyl starting [**2195-11-23**]. He underwent bone resection with podiatry [**2195-11-25**]. Based on culutre results, pan-sensitive mssa and enterococcus, so antibiotics were changed to unasyn on [**2195-11-28**]. He was taken back to the OR for wound closure on [**2195-11-30**]. He was then transitioned to augmentin. He was recommended to continue augmentin at least until he follows up with his primary podiatrist on [**2195-12-7**] at which time length of treatment course will be decided. He was evaluated by physical therapy on the day prior to discharge, and he was cleared to go home with home PT. He was recommended to remain non-weight bearing on his left foot.

4. Benign hypertension: The patient has chronic hypertension with poor blood pressure control. In the intensive care unit, his systolic blood pressure rose to almost 200, requiring treatment with hydralazine. The patient's home verapamil was continued, but his lisinopril was discontinued due to hyperkalemia. Lasix was used as needed for volume overload and his lisinopril was restarted with improved blood pressure control.

5. Volume overload: The patient developed increased work of breathing and volume overload in the setting of his D10 drip. The D10 drip was discontinued, and patient was treated with Lasix, with improvement in his symptoms.

6. Type II Diabetes melitus, uncontrolled with complications: His oral agents were held in house as above and glycemic control achieved with sliding scale of insulin. He was restarted on both his metformin and glipizide 24 hours prior to discharge, and his blood sugars remained stable between 80-200.

7. Atrial fibrillation: He was rate controlled with verapamil and digoxin. He is chronically anticoagulated with coumadin, and was admitted with an inr of 9.3. He had no bleeding. He was given vitamin k, with gradual improvement in his inr. His coumadin was held. This was restarted on [**2195-11-30**], and his INR was 2 on discharge.

8. Chronic diastolic heart failure: He was treated with intermittent diuresis for volume overload. He was restarted on ace inhibitor.

9. Anemia: He was noted to have anemia of chronic disease, with stable hct.
