EKG: Baseline artifact. Regular rhythm with left anterior fascicular block and right bundle-branch block configuration, probably sinus rhythm. Since the previous tracing of [**2130-2-3**] the QRS width is wider and R wave reversal in the lateral precordial leads is more marked, related to axis or lateral myocardial infarction. Clinical correlation is suggested.

 Brief Hospital Course: ## Hematochezia/Crohn's: Likely [**1-12**] combination of known Crohn's and overanticoagulation most likely due to drug interaction of coumadin w/ sasacol. Received 2Units FFP and 1 unit PRBC + vit K. With drop of Hct as low as 23.6, 27.0 upon d/c.  INR upon d/c 1.0.  Underwent colonoscopy showing ulcer in proximal ascending colon which wx bx to exclude ulcerated neoplasia, chrohn's dz which was bx, and pseudopolyps in the descending colon and sigmoid colon. . ## ARF: likely hypovolemia in setting of GIB, Cr of 1.6 from baseline of 1.0. Currently back to baseline. . ## Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: in sinus rhythm on [**Month/Day (2) 2304**]. - hold anticoag for now as risks outweigh benefits.  Will be restarted w/ f/u w/ PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] control meds because of bleeding, pt not in AF on [**Last Name (LF) 2304**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] restart BB w/ d/c to rehab facility.

 ## HTN: Meds held in setting of bleed, restarting OP meds w/ d/c to rehab.  Holding lasix [**1-12**] to continued dehydration [**1-12**] to poor PO intake. . ## DCM: appears euvolemic - hold furosemide in setting of GI bleed . ## h/o PE, LV thrombus: - hold anticoag in setting of GI bleed, will restart as outpatient.

 Discharge Medications: 1. Acetaminophen-Codeine 300-30 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain. 2. Pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.) Sig: One (1) Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.) PO Q24H (every 24 hours). 3. Lidocaine HCl 5 % Ointment Sig: One (1) Appl Topical Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours). 4. Atenolol 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day. 5. Lisinopril 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.

 Discharge Disposition: Extended Care

Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 533**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for Extended Care - [**Location 1268**]

Discharge Diagnosis: Lower GI Bleed

 Discharge Condition: Stable

 Discharge Instructions:   You are being discharged from the hospital after an admission for a lower gastrointestinal bleed.  Because of significant blood loss, you were stabilized throughout the admission with transfusion of blood products and clotting proteins.  You underwent colonoscopy to evaluate for source of the bleeding. It not only showed multiple areas of sick colon consistent with your Chron's disease, but also a non-bleeding ulcer in the bowel.  Multiple biopsy's were taken, results pending.  The most likely cause of your bleeding is your very low ability to clot due to a reaction between your blood thinner coumadin and the asacol which you started.  Both medications are being stopped, and only restarted after discussion between your PCP and your Gastroenterologist.    After being evaluated by Physical Therapy, it is felt that you would benefit from a short stay in an acute rehab facility to help improve your strength after this hospitalization.

Followup Instructions: Follow up w/ Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 216**] in [**12-12**] weeks ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1300**] Follow up w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2305**] in [**12-12**] weeks ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2306**]
