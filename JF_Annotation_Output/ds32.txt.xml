PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's temperature was 98.4. Heart rate 76 to 79.  Blood pressure 90/50.  Respirations 15. Sat 94 to 99% on 2 liters.  In general, well appearing and in no acute distress.  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.  No scleral icterus.  Oropharynx is clear. Conjunctiva were slightly pale.  No lymphadenopathy.  No bruits.  JVP approximately 8 cm.  Chest rales at the right base.  Cardiac regular.  S1 and S2.  No murmurs.  Abdomen was benign, soft, nontender.  Good bowel sounds.  He had a midline ventral hernia, which was soft. Liver was palpated 2 cm below the costal margin.  The patient was OB positive in the Emergency Department.  Extremities revealed 1+ pedal edema with venostasis changes bilaterally.  Skin examination had no rashes.  The patient s alert and oriented times three with a chronic left foot drop.

INITIAL LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 6.3, hematocrit 31.4, which then dropped to 24.3, baseline is 41.  Platelets 138.  SMA 7 notable for a sodium of 136, K of 4.7, bicarb 24, BUN 32, creatinine 0.5, glucose 158, INR 2.3.  Dilantin level was 3.0.  ALT 35, AST 51, alkaline phosphatase 203.  Total bilirubin .5, LDH 215, albumin 3.0.  Enzymes were cycled, which were negative.  The patient's electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, PR prolongation at 206.  Left axis deviation, inferior Qs, all of which were old.   There were some new T wave flattening in V2 to V6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Gastrointestinal bleed:  The patient was admitted with melena likely an upper gastrointestinal bleed given history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, question of enteric fistula.  Given history of hemochromatosis and early cirrhosis, question of varices, given history of reflux symptoms, question of esophagitis, gastritis.  The patient was again admitted with gastrointestinal bleed and was typed and crossed.  He was initially transfused 2 units for a hematocrit of 24.  He had two peripheral intravenouses in place.  INR was corrected with vitamin K 2 mg and 4 units of fresh frozen platelets and hematocrit revealed a change from 24 up to 26 after 4 units.  INR corrected to 1.7.  The patient  was also started on Protonix 40 intravenous b.i.d. Aspirin and Coumadin  were held.  The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on the following morning, which revealed grade 1 esophageal varices and mild gastritis esophagitis as well as portal gastropathy.  There was no active bleeding at any site.  The patient then underwent an abdominal CT, which was negative for aortic enteric fistula. On the following day the patient underwent a colonoscopy, which was normal up until the ascending colon.  However, they were not able to go all the way to the cecum and recommended virtual colonoscopy in the future and the patient had then underwent a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy with banding times four to the esophageal varices.  The patient will need a repeat banding procedure in ten days.  After the banding the patient was started on Sucralfate 1 gram q.i.d. and was continued on Protonix.  Again aspirin and Coumadin were held throughout.  After 4 units hematocrit stabilized from 24 up to 32 and remained stable at 32 upon discharge.

2.  Hypotension:  The patient was initially in the systolics in the 90s likely hypovolemic in the setting of a gastrointestinal bleed.  However, given the history of cardiac disease the patient's enzymes were cycled times three, which were negative.  He was resuscitated with fluid, fresh frozen platelets and packed red cells and blood pressure remained stable throughout.  After the esophagogastroduodenoscopy the Atenolol was switched to Nadolol given the history of cirrhosis and varices and Zestril was held up until discharge due to low blood pressures.

3.  Coronary artery disease:  Patient with a history of myocardial infarction in [**2180**] and [**2182**] and is status post stent of the percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2182**].  Enzymes were cycled, which were negative.  Aspirin and Coumadin were held due to gastrointestinal bleed.  Beta blocker and ace were initially held due to low blood pressures.  Lipitor was held secondary to new cirrhosis.  The patient was restarted on Nadolol upon discharge, however, aspirin, Coumadin, Zestril and Lipitor were held prior to discharge to be restarted by primary care physician at his or her discretion.

4.  Deep venous thrombosis:  Patient with recurrent left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, but admitted with gastrointestinal bleed.  INR 2.3, Coumadin was held due to multiple procedures and held upon discharge.  The patient will undergo repeat banding in ten days after which time the patient may or may not resume anticoagulation per primary care physician.

5.  Hemachromatosis:  The patient with hemachromatosis for long standing, now with evidence of cirrhosis on examination. The patient will continue with further phlebotomies as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and may need further workup for cirrhosis.

6.  History of abdominal aortic aneurysm:  Patient ruled out enteric fistula with negative abdominal CT.

7.  Seizure disorder:  The patient was given additional dose of Dilantin 400 times one and then restarted on his regular does of 300 and will continue on his regular dose.  No further seizure activity.

8.  Diabetes:  The patient was initially held NPO diabetic medications due to NPO status.  Was covered with a sliding scale.  Sugars remained stable and can restart Glyburide upon discharge.  Metformin held secondary to cirrhosis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1.  Esophageal varices s/p banding. 2.  Portal gastropathy. 3.  Gastritis esophagitis. 4.  Hemachromatosis with early cirrhosis. 5.  Coronary disease. 6.  Recurrent deep venous thrombosis. 7.  Congestive heart failure. 8.  Diabetes. 9.  s/p abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. 10.  Seizure disorder.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1.  Nadolol 20 q.d. 2.  Sucralfate one q.i.d. times seven days. 3.  Protonix 40 po q.d. 4.  Dilantin 300. 5.  Folate 1.

MEDICATIONS HELD: 1.  Aspirin. 2.  Coumadin. 3.  Lipitor. 4.  Zestril. 5.  Atenolol switched to Nadolol.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up with primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 410**].  Follow up with hematologist [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and follow up with liver specialist [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for repeat banding in ten days.  At the time of follow up, the timing for resuming anticoagulation should be addressed.
