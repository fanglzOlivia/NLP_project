Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: RIJ placed Hemodialysis

 History of Present Illness: Pt is an 80F with a history of severe AS, CAD, s/p nephrectomy for RCC with ESRD recently started on HD and recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for cough [**Date range (1) 135**] p/w cough. Today she woke up from sleep with acute shortness of breath and cough. NO Chest pain. Husband called 911. In the ER, afebrile HR 120s, SBP 110s. CXR with ? PNA. She was given ceftriaxone 1 gram and levofloxacin 750mg IV X1. Given continued resp distress intubated (rocuronium and etomidate). On presentation to the CCU pt intubated unable to provide history. Per husbandpt has had a severe cough since discharge from hosp productive for clear sputum. Overall has had a cough for ~3 mos (had been treated for PNA X2 most recently [**2174-5-15**]). She saw her cardiologist and who stopped her ramipril and switched her to losartan 1 day PTA. She has not had any fevers, nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis. Of note she had aoritc valvuloplasty on [**2174-5-10**] (initially valve area 0.56cm2, gradient 27 -> after the procedure the calculated aortic valve area was 0.74 cm2 and gradient 12 mmHg.) Pt has been on dialysis in the past but with improvement in creatinine she was not dialysed on Thursday (last dialysis [**2174-5-24**]).

 Past Medical History: Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2171**] anatomy as follows: -- LMCA clean -- LAD: mild disease -- LCX: mild disease with origin OM1 and OM2 60-70% stenosis -- RCA: ulcerated 50% proximal plaque w/ mild disease -- severe AS: [**Location (un) 109**] 0.8 cm2, peak gradient 50 -- EF 60% . Other Past History: -- severe AS: cardiac investigation in [**State 108**] by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 110**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 111**] revealed calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 1.0 cm2, valve gradient of 32 mm Hg. LVEF is 45-50% with apical akinesis.  She has 1+ MR. Cath at [**Hospital1 **] revealed [**Location (un) 109**] 0.8 cm2, moderate CAD at 30-40% except for 60-70% stenosis of OM1 and OM2.  Peak aortic valve gradient is 50, cardiac output is 3.2 liters/min.  No signficant carotid disease. -- h/o MRSA from LLE trauma in [**2173-7-14**] -- chronic systolic CHF, EF 30-40% -- right nephrectomy [**2165**] due to renal cell carcinoma -- ESRD on hemodialysis for one month -- h/o cholelithiasis -- osteoarthritis -- herpes zoster of the right which was intracostal -- h/o H. pylori -- anemia -- h/o right inguinal herniorrhaphy in [**2156**] -- myositis s/p muscle biopsy at [**Hospital1 112**], possibly related to statin use .

 Pertinent Results: Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**4-/2174**]: COMMENTS: 1. Limited coronary angiography demonstrated heavily calcified left main, left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries. The left circumflex had a heavily calcified proximal lesion. 2. LV ventriculography was deferred. 3. Successful Rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the proximal left circumflex artery with a Cypher (3x13mm) drug eluting stent postdilated to 3.5mm. Final angiography demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout the vessel (See PTCA Comments). FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. One vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Successful rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the proximal LCX with a drug eluting stent (Cypher). . . 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2174-5-20**] demonstrated:The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and moderate global hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.7cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small circumferential pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis. Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate global hypokinesis. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. .

EKG on admission-Sinus tachycardia with left bundle-branch block with secondary ST-T wave abnormalities. No diagnostic change from tracing #1. . [**Month/Day/Year **] on admission - The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and mild-moderate hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 30-35%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At least mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small, primarily anterior (?loculated) pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise with a prominent anterior fat pad. . [**6-6**] EKG - Sinus tachycardia. Left atrial abnormality. Left bundle-branch block. Left axis deviation. Secondary repolarization abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2174-6-4**] heart rate has increased. Otherwise, no major change. . CXRs over the course of admission showed slowly improving pulmonary edema, no major focal consolidations were seen. . Renal US - no hydronephrosis, patent renal artery.

Brief Hospital Course: # PUMP/Chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Patient presented with presumed acute exacerbation of chronic systolic heart, which has improved after ultrafiltration. [**Date Range **] with EF of 30-40% unchanged from prior. She currently appears fairly euvolemic, however her fluid status has remained difficult to manage given her low ejection fraction and poor urine output. - Continued home doses of carvedilol and losartan.  Were held initially for low blood pressures, but both restarted during her admission. - Hemodialysis was considered for fluid managment, but a trial of lasix proved successful.  She will now go home on 160 mg PO daily lasix and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**], her nephrologist. She will monitor daily weights/low sodium diet, pt had nutrition consult during stay. . # CAD: No evidence ACS during hospitalization. Patient is s/p recent LCx stent.  She was continued on ASA, carvedilol, plavix, and Losartan.

. #. Valves. No active issues. Severe AS a/p valvuloplasty [**2174-5-11**], stable AS per [**Month/Day/Year **]. Discussed with patient and family: per their report, patient was previously evaluated by Dr. [**Name (NI) 137**] in cardiac surgery and was not a candidate for valve replacment due to "calcifications." Patient may be candidate for new cath-assisted valve replacement. Also has mild MR on last [**Name (NI) 113**].  Pt should likely be re-evaluated after discharge. . # Respiratory distress resolved - Respiratory distress was suspected to be likely multifactorial secondary to volume overload and also PNA as supported by elevated WBC on presentation, fever, and now GNR in sputum gram stain but not growing on culture. Increased sputum overnight while afebrile, non-elevated white count likely represents resolving infection. Received monotherapy with ceftazadime only given GNR in sputum may be pseudomonas; antibiotics started [**5-29**], continued for 7 days.  She will continue lasix as outpatient to try and prevent pulm edema. . # ANEMIA/GIB: HCT drop was noted several two days into admission, unclear if represented true blood loss. NGT removed [**5-31**] and this demonstrated frank dark blood (+hemoccult) in NGT, likely representing bleed several days ago from gastritis. LDH and haptoglobin were checked with HCT drop and were within normal limits which is inconsistent with hemolysis. She received 1 u PRBCs soon after admission, and HCT has remained stable since. Her Hcts were between 26 and 28.  Stools were checked for guiac, and were positive two days prior to dicharge.  We discharged her home with protonix and recommend follow up with her PCP to continue to monitor CBCs for watch for blood loss.  She is not actively losing blood as seen by her stable Hcts.  We also recommend an outpatient colonoscopy.  Although, she needs to be very careful with the bowel prep, as that can cause large fluid shifts and drive her into pulmonary edema. . # Acute on chronic renal failure (stable Cr): Acute on chronic renal failure likely due to ATN secondary to hypotension versus ongoing pre-renal state. Patient had been initiated on HD in [**2174-3-15**]; was taken off HD ~1 week prior to admission. Volume overload/CHF on admission, improved with UF, now appears euvolemic. Creatinine 1.... on discharge.  Pt has history of RCC with nephrectomy.  Renal function has seemed to normalize.  Will continue follow up with nephrologist and he will also coordinate removal of dialysis catheter.

#  Pt was discharge to home with services for PT and home health care for dialysis catheter dressing changes.

 Discharge Disposition: Home With Service

Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare

Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: 1. Respiratory Failure 2. CHF 3. Renal Failure

Secondary Diagnoses: 1. Aortic Stenosis 2. Anemia 3. HTN

 Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile, pt walking with a walker, eating on her own, with a normal mental status.

 Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for respiratory distress due to fluid in your lungs from an acute episode of worsening heart failure.  You were intubated at the time, and when you were able to breath on your own, we continued to remove fluid from your lungs with diuretics.  We also are continuing to give you the medicines carvedilol and losartan for your heart failure.

You also will start taking lasix daily to ensure fluid stays off your lungs.

In addition, you had acute renal failure during this admission. Your kidney function improved, but you will continue to need follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**].  You also have a dialysis catheter in your chest that will need to be taken care of by a home nurse. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**] will discuss removal of the catheter as an outpatient.

We also found a trace amount of blood in your stool.  You should meet with your PCP and discuss having a colonoscopy.  Make sure to tell them you have heart failure because it does affect the bowel preparation they plan for you.

Once at home, weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs. Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet.  Call the nutritionist with any questions.

Also, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness or fainting or any other worrisome symptoms, do not hesitate to call your doctor or call 911 in case of emergency.
