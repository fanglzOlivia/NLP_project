Galactomannan - negative B-d-glucan - negative Cdiff - negative BCX - pending

Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 14**] is a 61 yo w/ Stage II breast cancer who was admitted on day 13 or cycle 2 of Docetaxel (Taxotere) + Cyclophosphomide who developed fever to 100.6 at home with associated rigors in the setting of neutropenia. . #Neutropenic Fever- On presentation the pt's PMN count was 21 most likely from her most recent chemotherapy cycle and lack of Neulasta use. Two possible sources of infection existed including pulmonary or from a laceration on her finger suffered while gardening. She was broadly covered with Vancomycin and cefepime to cover both possible sources, as well as flagyl to cover for cdiff as the patient mentioned that she had increased ostomy output.  When cdiff returned negative, flagyl was discontinued. Blood cultures were sent and a U/A was not concerning for infection. We also sent off galactomannan antigen and beta-D-glucan labs initially as part of her neutropenic fever workup which were negative. The following day after admission her WBC rose significantly and she no longer was neutropenic. As her WBC rose she started to develope a cough and he CXR became concerning for an infiltrate. She was continued on Vanc/Cefepime until afebrile and with ANC>1000 for greater than 48 hours, after which she was switched to PO levofloxacin to complete an 8 day total course for community acquired pneumonia. . # Hypotension- In the [**Name (NI) **] pt's SBP dropped to 70s, not responding to IVF boluses. She refused central line placement in the ED and peripheral pressors were initiated. This is most likely related to her underlying infectious process. She was not administered any medications recently that could be accounting for her hypotension. Looking through OMR her baseline blood pressures are sbp of 90s-100s. An a-line was obtained which showed higher BP than what was being recorded by the blood pressure cuff. She was given several liters of IV fluid boluses and weaned off pressors the night of admission to the ICU. Her cuff and a-line pressures correlated after fluid resuscitation and the a-line was discontinued. . # Breast Cancer- currently in cycle 2 of Docetaxel (Taxotere) + Cyclophosphomide. Most likely this current episode of neutropenia is due to the fact that Neulasta was not given during this cycle of chemo per pt's request, however due to the rapid rise in her WBC count myelosuppression from sepsis was also a possibility. . # Depression / Anxiety- Continue Duloxetine and clonazepam at home doses. . # Nausea- Continued compazine and PO zofran prn.

 Discharge Instructions: Dear [**Known firstname 17**],

It was a pleasure to take care of you here at [**Hospital1 18**]. You were admitted for low white cell (neutrophil count), fever, and pneumonia. You required monitoring with blood pressure supporting medications and IV antibiotics in the intensive care unit. Fortunately, your counts improved and you responded nicely to the antibiotics. Please continue to take levofloxacin to treat your pneumonia for a total of 8 days (last dose on [**2154-5-7**]). As we discussed if you notice fever, worsening breathing problems, or any other concerning symptoms to return to the emergency room immediately.

We have made the following changes to your medications:

START levofloxacin 750mg by mouth daily for 4 more days ([**2154-5-7**])

You should discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**] the possibility of restarting neulasta with your next chemotherapy cycle.
