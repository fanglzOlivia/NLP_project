Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1481**] Chief Complaint: New diagnosis Colon Cancer

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2131-7-11**]: ERCP with sphincterotomy [**2131-7-16**]: laparoscopic right colectomy

 History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 2302**] is a 70 y.o. male with hx of Crohn's disease, afib, dilated CMP, h/o PE who presents after recent discharge due to colon biopsies found positive for Colon Cancer.  Pt recent admission was for bloody stools and significantly elevated INR. During this admission he had colonoscopy with multiple biopsies.  He was discharged in stable condition without any IBD meds and without anticoagulation.  He was called by PCP and told to come back due to positive colon biopsy and need for further staging/workup.  Pt denies any grossly bloody stools at home, has not been taking any meds and has been tolerating po well with minimal rectal pain.

Past Medical History: 1. Crohn's dz, found in [**2125**] on colonoscopy for anal fissure, positive [**Doctor First Name **], been treated with Remicade 2. Rheumatoid arthritis 3. HTN 4. hx of renal calculus 5. s/p appendectomy 6. s/p TURP 7. s/p cholecystectomy 8. Recent pulmonary embolism- on coumadin since [**2-12**] 9. LVH, LV enlargement, apical LV aneurysm with LV thrombus, EF 25% 10. Chronic left knee pain s/p meniscectomy, synovectomy, and debridement of left knee [**2123**] 11. Recent gallstone pancreatitis [**2-12**] 12. Afib - [**2-12**] rate controlled on atenolol

 Social History: Married for 46 years and lives with wife.  3 children who all live in area.  No tobocco, h/o occasional ETOH, stopped drinking in [**11-13**], denies h/o ETOH abuse.  No illicit drugs.

 Family History: Father died at 62 from MI Mother died at 52 of cirrhosis No cancer or diabetes to patient's knowledge No history of clotting disorders

Physical Exam: T-96.8 BP-140/70 P-96 RR-20 Sats-95% on RA Gen: NAD, comfortable HEENT: NCAT, EOMI, MMM, oropharynx CV: irreg/irreg no m/r/g no JVD RESP: CTAB no w/r/crackles ABD: soft/NT/ND/NABS EXTR: no c/c/edema, +PT pulses bilaterally

Pertinent Results: Admission Labs: [**2131-7-4**]  WBC-8.7 RBC-3.87* HGB-10.5* HCT-31.9* MCV-82 MCH-27.2 MCHC-33.0 RDW-16.4*  CALCIUM-8.2* PHOSPHATE-2.8 MAGNESIUM-1.9 GLUCOSE-84 UREA N-12 CREAT-0.9 SODIUM-139 POTASSIUM-4.2 CHLORIDE-106 TOTAL CO2-26 ANION GAP-11   PLT COUNT-352 CEA 1.5

[**2131-7-10**]: ECHO LA is normal in size. No ASD is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric LV hypertrophy. LV cavity is moderately dilated. There is a sessile mural thrombus at the LV apex; the clot is mural and not mobile. Overall LV systolic function is moderately-to-severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls, and extensive apical akinesis. There is no VSD. RV chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. AV leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but AS is not present. Mild (1+) AR is seen. MV leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no MVP. Mild (1+) MR is seen. LV inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The estimated PA systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for review) of [**2130-2-3**], a LV apical thrombus is now present

[**2131-7-9**] Stress Test: IMPRESSION: No significant ST-T wave changes in the setting of baseline ST-T wave abnormalities. No anginal-type symptoms. Nuclear report sent separately.

[**2131-7-9**] PMIBI: IMPRESSION: 1. Abnormal study. 2. Severe, fixed perfusion defect involving the inferior wall and the a large region at the apex. 3. Moderately dilated LV. 4. Akinetic apex and inferior wall with LVEF 28%.

[**2131-7-9**] MRI Abdomen IMPRESSION: 1. Hypodense flat subcapsular lesion within segment IV-B on prior CT from [**2131-7-6**], demonstrates a slight delayed enhancement; however gross stability since [**2129-4-9**] CT abdomen and pelvis suggest a benign lesion. This lesion is amenable to further evaluation by targeted ultrasound, possibly with biopsy, as clinically indicated. 2. Vague 1.3 cm lesion in segment 7 on prior CT from [**2131-7-6**] is not clearly visualized. However, this examination is motion limited and a small lesion within this vicinity cannot entirely be excluded. 3. Filling defect in the lower common bile duct suggests choledocholithiasis without evidence of acute obstruction.

[**2131-7-6**] CT chest/abd/pelvis w/ w/o contrast 1) 3.7 cm irregular soft tissue mass at the lateral aspect of the ascending colon, associated with lymph nodes, corresponding to the colon cancer seen on colonoscopy. Small amount of fluid along the right paracolic gutter, probably due to biopsy. 2) Featureless appearance of the descending and sigmoid colon, with increased wall thickening and fat stranding in the descending colon, suggestive of active inflammation due to Crohn's disease.

3) Ill-defined 1.3 cm lesion in the segment 7 of the liver, for which metastasis is suspected given the colon cancer. Further evaluation by multiphasic MRI is recommended. 4) Unchanged nodular appearance of the left adrenal gland. The finding can be evaluated at the time of MRI as well. 6) New bilateral pleural effusion. 7) Increased mucosal enhancement in the perianal region, with probable perianal fistula on the right, new since prior study. 8) Multiple hypodense lesions in the kidney, unchanged since prior study.

Brief Hospital Course: 70 y.o. male with hx of Crohn's disease, afib, dilated CMP, h/o PE who presents after recent discharge for LGIB in setting of supratherapeutic INR on the same day when colon biopsies were found positive for Colon Cancer. Patient was admitted for metastatic work-up and cardiology clearance prior to colonic mass resection. . ## Colon Cancer: CT abdomen with 3-4 cm mass in ascending colon with enlarged LNs, biopsies positive for Ca. Pt had CT of torso for staging, showing possible metastatic dz of a single nodule in the liver. MRI w/ liver protocol performed, without lesion suspicious for mets. Cardiology recommended addition of statin, asa, heparin gtt prior to surgery. Pt at mod-high risk for moderate risk surgery. . ## Dilated CMP/Systolic dysfuction: monitoring strict I/Os, remained euvolemic. Continue meds of Lisinopril and Atenolol. Stress w/ no significant ST-T wave changes or anginal-type pain in setting of stress on [**7-9**]. PMIBI with evidence of fixed profusion deficit, severe apical [**Last Name (LF) 2307**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 28%. Cardiology consulted. ECHO on [**7-10**] showed mural thrombus and apical aneurysm. Restarted ASA and started simvastatin and Heparin gtt. Pt to require long-term anticoagulation on discharge. . # Choledochololithiasis: Seen on MRI of the abdomen. Patient s/p ERCP w/ sphinctorotmy on [**7-11**] without complication. . ## Recent GI bleed/Anemia: Hematocrit is stable at 26-30. Pt denies any grossly bloody stools. Given mural thrombus, on IV heparin until colon resection. [ ]will send stools for guiac and monitor hct daily. . ## Crohn's Disease - Stable, primarily rectal involvement. Patient on lidocaine jelly and prn tylenol #3 for rectal pain. Currently on no treatment for Crohn's given colon ca diagnosis.

. ## Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: pt was discharged without anticoagulation on last admission after being admitted with an INR > 7. Benefits of anticoagution are outweighed by the risks at this time.  To resume coumadin post-op. . ## Benign essential HTN: Controlled on Atenolol and lisinopril . ## h/o PE: anticoagulation with Heparin gtt . ## FEN: Heart healthy diet, will replete lytes prn. . ## PPX: SCDs, bowel regimen . ## FULL CODE
