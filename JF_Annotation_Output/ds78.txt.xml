Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Febrile, unresponsive--> GBS meningitis and bacteremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1. Rigid bronchoscopy, debridement, T-tube placement. 2. Baclofen Pump Removal. 3. RUQ Hematoma Evacuation. 4. Percutaneous Gastrostomy Tube. 5. Left Antecubital PICC Line.

 History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 31**] is a 62 y.o. woman with primary progressive MS [**Name13 (STitle) 32**] in [**2143**] with spasticity s/p intrathecal baclofen pump placment in '[**64**], s/p tracheostomy in '[**65**] [**1-8**] to chronic respiratory weakness, recurrent UTIs, aspiration PNAs, who presents after being found to be febrile and unresponsive at her nursing home.  According to notes from [**Hospital6 33**], the pt was found at her nursing home yesterday ([**3-26**]) AM, shaking her head repeatedly, subsequently becoming obtunded (presumed seizure). She was taken by EMS to [**Hospital1 34**] ED. . In the ED at [**Name (NI) 34**], pts vitals were: Tm 103.6, HR 110-150s RR 12-18 SaO2 98-99%NRB. Soon after, pt supposedly seized in the ED, was given Ativan, Ambu'd and subsequently placed on SIMV ventilation. Pt was empirically started on Vancomycin, Levoquin, Ceftriaxone, Bactrim and Acyclovir. On exam, it was noted that the skin overlying the baclofen pump (RUQ) appeared inflamed. Labs were notable for a WBC of 25 with 68%polys and a bandemia of 20%. U/A with 50-100 WBC, +leukocyte esterase, +nitrite. LP was performed and CSF analysis showed 7,250 WBCs with 92% polys, glucose 10, TP 1440, and gm stain with many polys, few gm+ cocci. Bcx revealed gm+ cocci in chains in [**3-9**] bottles. Micro lab performed latex agglutination on CSF sample which was positive for group B strep. Vanc and Ceftriaxone were dc'd and ampicillin 2gm IV + benadryl given. Hydrocortisone 80mg was also given. Left SC line and NGT were also placed at [**Hospital1 34**]. CXR showed cardiomegaly but no infiltrate. Abdominal CT was negative for an abscess or fluid collection surrounding the pump. Head CT showed questionable changes from prior that might suggest the possibility of a right MCA infarct. Pt was transferred directly to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further management.

 Past Medical History: PMH: 1. Chronic progressive multiple sclerosis - dx'd in [**2143**] when pt was 34 years old; on intrathecal baclofen pump ('[**64**]) for spasticity 2. Recurrent UTIs and hosp. for urosepsis - thought [**1-8**] to chronic indwelling Foley catheter for neurogenic bladder. Last admitted [**Date range (3) 35**] for urosepsis 3. Recurrent aspiration PNA - [**3-/2162**], [**10/2166**] - admitted both times requiring MICU stay, during '[**65**] admission trach was placed because was unable to clear secretions on her own [**1-8**] to respiratory weakness 1/03 admitted for lingular PNA, unclear if [**1-8**] to aspiration 4. COPD 5. HTN 6. Osteoporosis 7. Scarlet fever as a child 8.  Chronic constipation 9. Hx of sacral decubitus ulcer

 Social History: Social History: Pt is widowed. She has no children. She currently lives in a nursing home. Has been there since '[**65**]? She has no hx of smoking, EtOH, IVDU. Will call sister tomorrow for more information.

Family History: Noncontributory

Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci  -NON-FERMENTER, NOT PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA. pan [**Last Name (un) 36**] (except bactrim) . TTE on admission: 1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. 2. No obvious mass or vegetation seen. . CT abd post-op: 1) Large hematoma in the superficial tissues of the right upper quadrant with associated edema and tracking into the abdominal wall. No extension into the peritoneal space is seen. The covering intern was notified by telephone at 10:30 a.m. on [**3-28**], [**2171**].

2) Gallbladder with dense material . this could represent stones, sludge or vicarious excretion of iv contrast. If clinically indicated, an ultrasound can be obtained for further characterization.

3) Bilateral small kidneys with small nonobstructing stones.

4) Atelectasis and small pleural effusions at both lung bases. . EEG [**2172-3-28**]: This is a markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the

presence of generalized bursts of polymorphic disorganized slowing followed by periods of suppression. In addition, there were independent bifrontal sharp slow waves seen. This finding suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and is consistent with a severe encephalopathy. A repeat EEG may be helpful to further evaluate the severity of the encephalopathy. . EEG [**2172-3-31**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG obtained in stage II sleep with brief periods of drowsiness due to the presence of intermittent and independent shifting slowing in the parasagital region on both sides. This finding suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and is consistent with the diagnosis of meningoencephalitis. In addition, exessive drowsiness was seen, perhaps also related to the underlying infection. . MRI [**4-4**]: Increased signal along the occipital horns could be due to cellular debris from meningitis. No evidence of acute infarct seen. Mild to moderate ventriculomegaly indicating mild communicating hydrocephalus. . MRV [**4-4**]: The head MRV demonstrates normal flow signal in the superior sagittal and transverse sinus without evidence of thrombosis. Deep venous system also demonstrates normal flow signal. . MRA [**4-4**]: Somewhat limited MRA of the head due to motion. No evidence of vascular occlusion seen. . TEE: 1.The left atrium is normal in size. 2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). 3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 4.There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. 6.The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. 7.There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. . Head CT [**4-7**]: Stable appearance of the ventricles and sulci.

 Brief Hospital Course: 1. GBS meningitis/bactermia In the unit, the pt was continued on Ampicillin and started on Gentamicin (for synergy). Her intrathecal baclofen pump was thought to be infected (on exam, erythema and warmth overlying pump in RUQ). Pt went to surgery to have pump removed and the operation appeared to be without complication. The following day, pt had 11 point hematocrit drop and was noted to be hypotensive with an SBP of 70. After spiking a temp, it was thought that she might be septic. She was given fluids, PRBCs, FFP, and placed on Levophed. Abd CT demonstrated a 7 x 13x 11 cm hematoma in the RUQ at the former pump site. Pt was taken emergently to surgery where the hematoma was evacuated, slow ooze noted, and the bleeding vessel cauterized. She returned to the floor and remained hemodynamically stable. Given 1 additional unit of PRBCs. Her hct bumped appropriately and remained in the high 20s for the rest of her unit course. Pt developed erythematous macular rash on face, arms, knees thought to be [**1-8**] to PCN allergy. Amp was d/c'd and replaced briefly with Vanc and then changed permanently to Cefrtriaxone. Repeat LP was performed since the pt continued to be minimially responsive (withdrawing to pain, occ. opening eyes to name). CSF analysis showed a resolving bacterial meningitis. Prior to leaving the unit, pt spiked a temp to 101.2. She was pancultured and all cultures were negative. A TTE ruled out endocarditis in the setting of group B strep bacteremia.  On day #12 of gentamycin, pt was changed to vanc/ceftaz for the completion of her treatment course. . 2. RUQ Hematoma: As above, after the removal of the baclofen pump, pt had a hct drop and hypotensive episode and was found to be bleeding into the RUQ pocket.  She was taken to the OR for emergent evacuation of the hematoma.  On POD #16, pt was noted to have oozing from the a site above the stitches in her RUQ. Neurosurgery was reconsulted and they recommended an abdominal ultrasound which showed vast improvement in the RUQ hematoma but found a new fluid collection.  Surgery was consulted and they diagnosed a seroma and recommended conservative management given that it had no signs of infection. . 3. Pneumonia: Towards the end of the pt's ICU stay, she was evaluated by speech and swallow and she had a very difficult time with the passy-muir valve.  She underwent bronchoscopy and BAL was sent for culture.  The culture returned positive for MRSA and gram negative rods (not pseudomonas).  She was started on vancomycin for MRSA and ceftaz/levaquin for double coverage of the GNR. Once the GNR sensitivities showed that it was not pseudomonas, ceftaz was stopped.  Of note, pt had vancomycin troughs that were persistently high.  Vancomycin troughs should be checked often and vanc should be adjusted for a level<15.  After the pt's swallowing study, she was noted to have increased secretions and some food particles were suctioned up so it was assumed that the pt aspirated.  That day she also spiked a temperature to 100 so Flagyl was added for anaerobic coverage. Vancomycin and Levaquin will be finished on [**4-20**] (14-day course) and Flagyl's course will be complete on [**4-24**] (after 10 days). . 4. Supraglottic edema As above, pt was evaluated by interventional pulmonary after she failed a passy-muir valve.  On bronchoscopy it was noted that she had severe supraglottic edema with grabulation tissue and the vocal cords could only be minimally visualized.  She was taken to the OR two days later for a rigid bronchoscopy where her granulation tissue was debrided and a t-tube was placed. ENT evaluated the patient and recommended a CT of the trachea to evaluate her anatomy.  The CT showed tracheal bronchomalacia and narrowing of the glottic and subglottic airway.  Ideally, she will get surgery by ENT to improve her subglottic edema when the patient has recovered from her acute illnesses. . 5. Anemia: Iron studies indicate anemia of chronic disease. Pt's baseline hct is between 26 and 29 and except for the hct drop after the bleed in the RUQ pocket, pt's hct remained stable. . 6. Multiple sclerosis Pt started on oral baclofen prior to pump removal. She was without signs of baclofen withdrawal (i.e. incr HR, temp, BP, seizures) once pump was removed. She continued on Baclofen 20mg qid po with an Ativan taper. PO baclofen was then tapered to 20mg tid. . 7. Mental status At baseline, although pt is significantly debilitated by MS, she is alert, oriented, and conversant. Her decreased responsiveness was thought to be [**1-8**] to meningitis, but although pt seemed to have resolving temp and WBC with Abx, her diminished reponsiveness persisted. Repeat LP in the unit suggested a resolving meningitis.  Neurology was following the pt and recommended an MRI to rule out stroke (esp given her ? of stroke at OSH) an MRV to rule out sinus thrombosis and an EEG to rule out subclinical seizures.  An EEG on HD #3 was consistent with severe encephalopathy and an EEG on HD #6 was consistent with meningoencephalitis with no evidence of seizures.  An MRI was finally done on HD #10 and showed mild communicating hydrocephalus, no evidence of cavernous thrombosis or stroke. Towards the end of her unit stay pt opened eyes to name and eventually returned to her baseline mental status.  Pt's mental status remained at baseline and pt will follow-up with neurology as an outpatient. . 8. Respiratory status After a supposed seizure at OSH pt was mechanically ventilated thru her trach site b/c no breath sounds were appreciated. (At baseline, pt has respiratory weakeness 2/2 to multiple sclerosis but does not require mechical ventilation. Trach in place to help with clearance of secretions.)  Pt placed on A/C in unit, then transferred to CPAP and eventually placed on a trach mask with good results.  At time of discharge, she was satting well on 40% trach mask. . 9. HTN In unit, pt initially normotensive, then mid-way through stay became hypertensive with SBPs in the 150-170s. Pt has hx of hypertension. Unclear whether BP was rebounding from baclofen d/c. BP became well-controlled with systolic BP in the 90s-110s on standing doses of Lisinopril 20mg po, Metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **]. . 10. Sacral decub ulcer: Stage 1-2.  Wound care nurse followed while pt was in-house. . 11. FEN: During pt's acute illness, she had an NGT placed. Speech and swallow evaluated the pt and recommended thin liquids and pureed food.  The following day, she was noted to have soup coming out of her trach so she was again made NPO.  Pt then passed the video swallow but again had some signs of aspiration after trying some ground solids.  She was made NPO and GI placed a PEG for feeding.  Pt should remain on tube feeds until her tracheal swelling is much improved.  At that point, another swallowing study can be performed and another trial of po feeding. . 12. Code: DNR/DNI
