Brief Hospital Course: 65yo man with many medical problems p/w hypotension in the setting of rapid aitral flutter. Also with a Urinary Tract Infection.

Assessment/Plan: 64 year-old male w/ history of lung ca s/p right pneumonectomy, severe COPD, recent trach and [**Month/Day/Year 282**] [**Hospital **] rehab with a flutter 2:1, leukocytosis, hypotension and UTI. . 1. Hypotension:  [**Month (only) 116**] have been due to infection from UTI vs. symptomatic tachycardia. Responded to aggresive fluid resusciation and rate control. Remained normotensive for the rest of hospitalization. Of note, his blood pressures were lower in left arm and family reported that this is a [**Last Name 294**] problem for him. . 2. Atrial Flutter: He has a known history of paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation.His was initially in rapid Atrial Fluuter with 2:1 conduction. This initially responded to diltiazem. On hopital day #2 he went back into artial flutter and in consultation with Electrophysiology service Amiodarone was initiated and diltiazem was stopped (as he had been on Amiodarone for 3.5 years in the past, and it had to be discontinued [**10-31**] due to bradycardia when lopressor was added).  He remained in sinus rhythm for the remainder of the hospitalization. Plan is continue Amiodarone 400mg TID x 1 week then 400mg [**Hospital1 **] x 1 week then 200mg po QD thereafter.  He is to avoid beta blockers and calcium channel blockers.

3. Respiratory Failure:  His chest x-ray showed no evidence of Pneumonia. Due to a notable trach leak, his trach was changed by respiraotory. An interventional Pulmonolgy consult was obtained due to concern of cuff leak and possible tracheomalacia.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended keeping the cuff pressures low with a cuff leak to prevent further tracheamalacia-- he would be willing to change the trach to a foam-filled trach ([**Last Name (un) 295**] tube) in the future if the cuff leak is interfering with the ability to ventilate.  He was continued on PS as tolerated with periods of rest on Assist Control. . 4. Klebsiella Urinary Tract Infection: He was initally started on ceftriaxone which was changed to levofloxacin but given history of heart block to levo, he was changed to Bactrim to complete a 7-day course for complicated UTI. The Urine Culture grew Klebsiella which is sensitive to Bactrim.His foley catheter was discontinued. . 5.Acute Blood Loss Anemia: His baseline hematocrit was 28-30. He was initially hemo-concentrated, but then on hospital day #3, his hematorcit dropped to 19.  due to extensive bleeding from site of central line, he was transfused 2 UPRBC and had an appropriate bump in his hematocrit. He was noted to have [**Known lastname **] guaiac positive stool, but this was in the setting of extensive bleeding from Internal Jugular catheter site into his trach/mouth. His hematocrit should be followed as an outpatient, and his stools should be continued to check guauic studies for trace blood. . 6. Bleeding from Central Line site. He is maintained on coumadin for Atrial Fibrillation and his inital INR was therapeutic. After IJ placement, he had continued oozing from IJ site leading to anemia with hct 19.   He was given FFP and vitamin K (0.5 mg iv) to reverse his coagultopathy. He should be restarted on coumadin for Atrial Fibrillation at rehab. . 5. Diabetes Mellitis: He was continued on glargine and regular insulin sliding scale. His sugars were in good control. . 6. Pain/anxiety/depression: He was continued on his outpatient doses of Fentanyl 75mcg/q72hours, Haldol for anxiety 5mg hs, 2mg 8am/2pm, 1mg tid/prn, and paxil.   His pain is from his scaral decubitus ulcer. . 7. Sacral Decubitus: He was seen by wound care nurse and continued on DSD for sacral wound. . 8. Left Upper Extremity Swelling: He had U/S which showed... . 9. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: He was given lasix prn to keep fluid even. . 10.Code: FULL . 11. Dispo: Discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehab. . 12. Access: The Right Internal Jugular Vein triple lumen catheter was not discontinued per [**Hospital1 296**] request. This was placed on [**2179-3-21**]. ------ Outstanding issues on discharge: 1.The pt was started on coumadin at 5 mg qday on day of discharge [**3-26**].  Please monitor his INR and adjust dose accordingly. 2.The pt has a swollen L arm and had U/S on day of discharge to r/o clot. No read has been given yet. Please call [**Hospital1 18**] to follow this up. Regardless, he is being restarted on anticoagulation which would be treatment of choice.
