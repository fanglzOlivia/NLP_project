 Service: MEDICINE

Allergies: Lisinopril / Nsaids / Nesiritide

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1881**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: HD

History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 86F with h/o colon cancer, ESRD on hemodialysis, diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension, and prior cephalic vein thrombosis who presented to the ED on [**8-15**] with dyspnea.

The patient's dialysis catheter became dislodged [**8-12**]. Consequently she missed her normal dialysis session [**8-13**]. On [**8-14**] she had a new tunneled catheter placed, but was not dialyzed. The afternoon of [**8-14**] her daughter noticed that the patient seemed increasingly dyspneic and was hypertensive to 200's. She was given hydralazine and clonidine and the BP improved to 160's. She called her daughter ~3am on [**8-15**] due to worsening dyspnea. The patient denies any accompanying headache, vision changes, chest discomfort, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, cough, weakness or loss of sensation. EMS was called, and she was given CPAP with some relief of her dyspnea. Per her daughter, similar symptoms have occurred 3 times in the past.

In the ED her vitals were BP 258/61 RR 28 O2 100% on CPAP, 89% on room air (temperature was not recorded). She was started on a nitroglycerin drip, and given calcium and bicarbonate for a potassium of 7.1. She was weaned off NIPPV, with O2 saturation of 97% on 3L NC. She was subsequently transferred to the ICU for further monitoring and dialysis.

Past Medical History: 1) Hypertension 2) Stage V chronic kidney disease, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**]. 3) Diastolic CHF (EF 60% on TTE in [**5-3**]), likely volume related in the setting of her renal disease. 4) Rheumatic fever, with the following valvular abnormalities: Mild aortic stenosis, moderate aortic regurgitation, mild mitral stenosis, mild to moderate MR, mild TR. 5) Severe PA systolic hypertension 6) Renal artery stenosis:  MRI [**2185**] atrophic R kidney, moderate stenosis of R renal artery, L renal artery normal. 7) Peripheral vascular disease:  Has claudication. 8) Right cephalic vein DVT in [**6-/2193**] 9) Colon cancer in [**2-/2192**], status post resection. 10) Hyperlipidemia 11) Right bundle branch block 12) Anemia of renal failure 13) Osteoarthritis 14) Osteopenia 15) Glaucoma

 Social History: Lives at home, usually alone, but recently the daughter has moved in with her.  She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use IV drugs.

 Family History: mother- HTN

Physical Exam: T 98.2 P 50 BP 196/76 O2 97% on 2L RR 24

General: Pleasant elderly woman in no acute distress CV: Regular rate S1 S2 II/VI SEM at RUSB with I/VI diastolic decrescendo murmur as well at RUSB Pulm: Lungs with crackles at bases bilaterally, no wheezes or rhonchi. R chest with tunneled catheter. Abd: Soft, nontender, +BS Extrem: Warm and well perfused, no edema Neuro: Alert and answering questions appropriately, moving all extremities

[**8-15**] CXR FINDINGS:  AP view of the chest on upright position.  The cardiac silhouette cannot be evaluated on this AP view.  The right-sided central venous catheter is unchanged.  The left costophrenic angle is blunted consistent with pleural effusions.  Left lung base atelectasis are noted.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There is a right lung base opacity obscuring the right-side cardiac border which may represent right middle lobe atelectasis vs. pneumonia. Pprominence of the pulmonary vasculature is noted, consistent with mild CHF. The osseous structures are unchanged.   IMPRESSION: 1.  Right middle lobe atelectasis vs. pneumonia. 2.  Mild CHF with small left- sided pleural effusion.

[**8-15**] EKG Sinus bradycardia at 56bpm, left axis, old RBBB, peaked T's that are new compared to [**2194-6-24**] EKG. Inverted T in V3 on [**6-2**] EKG has flipped to positive. No signs of acute ischemia.

Brief Hospital Course: 1. Dyspnea - The patient's dyspnea was thought to be secondary from volume overload, occuring in the context of ESRD and a missed hemodialysis session, as well as hypertension leading to flash pulmonary edema. Her dyspnea following hemodialysis.

2. Hypertension - The patient's hypertension is also likely related to volume overload. Her blood pressures improved following dialysis and resumption of her home course of toprol, clonidine, amlodipine, and hydralazine.

3. Hyperkalemia - The patient's potassium normalized following dialysis.

4. ESRD - Renal following, on dialysis MWF.

5. FEN - Continue sevelemer, nephrocaps.
