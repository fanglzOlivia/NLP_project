Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: picc line and central access

 History of Present Illness: 65 year-old gentleman with multiple medical problem including history of lung cancer post right pneumonectomy in [**2174**], severe COPD, post tracheostomy and [**Year (4 digits) 282**] placement(respiratory failure due to pneumonia) recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for urosepsis, now presenting yet again with hypotension and altered mental status.

Patient unable to give a history at this time so obtained from records. Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**3-26**] after an admission at [**Hospital1 18**] for a Klebsiella UTI and hypotension. Since his admission there, the pt has been alert and getting out of bed to the commode with assistance. On [**4-11**], the pt became lethargic and then gradually unresponsive. On [**4-12**], his BP decreased to 60 over palp and the pt was noted to be diaphoretic. He received a 500 cc bolus with an increase in his BP to 90/40. He remained unresponsive during this time. ABG showed 7.265/92.7/82 on an FiO2 of 0.50 with a temperature of 99.4. Of note, pt's triple lumen was placed [**2179-3-21**]. . Wife later arrived at the hospital and was able to provide additional history. She reports that he had been doing very well until Friday. They were working on weaning him and he was able to be on the trach mask for 1-2 hours at a time. However, on Friday, the pt felt mildly more SOB per his report. He was maintained exclusively on the vent over the rest of the weekend. Yesterday, the pt's wife reports that he looked "very scared" and would often stare at the ceiling. He also had periods of his eyes "rolling back in his head". He was occasionally responsive to her. She reports that they had been checking ABGs over the last 24 hours and his CO2 had been elevated. When they changed the vent settings to decrease the CO2, she felt that he was slightly less confused. She also notes that he was very diaphoretic yesterday and his faced appeared red and swollen. The pt's BP has always been very low in his left arm and she reports that they just starting taking his pressure there due to a skin tear on the right. . In the ED, the pt's VS were, 99.8 85 80/60-L 150/80-R 20 100% AC 400/20/100%/PEEP 5. He received vancomyicin and zosyn. Pt was initially started on levophed for hypotension. However, after learning that his BP has always been considered to be abnormally low in the left arm, it was checked in the right and has been stable in the 120s off of pressors. No new consolidation on CXR. Normal lactate. Currently getting a liter of NS .

studies: ECG- Sinus rhythm at 72 beats per minute. Nonspecific ST-T wave changes but no major changes since previous studies. . CXR- Stent projecting over the right brachiocephalic vein. Right lung remains opacified with shift of the cardiac and mediastinal contours toward the right consistent with previous pneumonectomy. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle which could represent pleural thickening or small left pleural effusion. Slightly increased interstitial markings int he left lung which appear stable. No new left pneumo or focal consolidation. . Head CT (WET READ)- No hemorrhage, shift, mass effect, or evidence of hydrocephalus. No evidence of a major CVA.

US upper extremity:IMPRESSION: 1) Nonocclusive thrombus in the left cephalic vein. 2) Nonocclusive thrombus in the distal left brachial veins

Transabdominal ultrasound examination was performed. The gallbladder is not distended. There is an 8-9 mm stone located at the neck of the gallbladder. The gallbladder wall is thickened. There are possible crystal or tiny cholesterol polyps located at the fundus of the gallbladder. No intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is identified. The common duct is not dilated and measures 3 mm. Flow in the portal vein is anterograde. Limited evaluation of the liver demonstrates no focal abnormality.

IMPRESSION: Thickened gallbladder wall with a stone in the gallbladder neck in a nondistended gallbladder. In the proper clinical setting, these findings may be consistent with cholecystitis. They are not completely typical for acute cholecystitis. Gallbladder wall thickening may also be produced by third spacing of fluids. If there is continued clinical concern for cholecystitis, a HIDA scan may be performed for further evaluation.

TECHNIQUE: CT images of the chest without the administration of IV contrast.

COMPARISON: [**2176-9-11**] and [**2179-3-21**].

FINDINGS: Soft tissue window images demonstrate changes of prior right pneumonectomy and mediastinal shift towards the right. There is no pathologic axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy. There is a left pleural effusion. The patient is intubated with a tracheostomy tube. A stent is again identified within the right brachiocephalic vein. The heart demonstrates coronary calcifications, but is normal in size. The main pulmonary artery appears prominent measuring 3.5 cm.

Lung window images demonstrate multifocal nodular opacities seen scattered throughout the left lung. No specific areas of cavitation are identified within these nodules. Atelectasis is also seen at the left lung base. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. Septal thickening is seen throughout the left lung field. A small 3-mm nodule seen on the prior studies is again seen, though slightly difficult to discern given the surrounding septal thickening and nodular opacities. However, on the study from [**2179-3-21**], this nodule was clearly seen and appears stable dating back to [**2176-9-11**]. The bronchi appear patent to the segmental level within the left lung.

Images of the upper abdomen demonstrate high-density material within dependent portion of the gallbladder, probably relating to sludge. A percutaneous gastrostomy tube is seen within the stomach. The remainder of the visualized portion of the upper abdomen is unremarkable other than arterial calcifications. The soft tissues are unremarkable. Degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracic spine.

IMPRESSION: 1) Multifocal nodular opacities seen scattered throughout the entire left lung. These most likely represent aspiration pneumonia. Septic emboli are considered less likely based on the CT appearance. 2) Mild CHF. 3) Left upper lobe nodule seen on the prior study of [**2179-3-21**] demonstrates stability dating back to [**2176-9-11**]. 4) Probable sludge within the gallbladder. 5) Findings suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.

 Brief Hospital Course: 65 y/o man with PMH significant for squamous cell lung CA, type 2 DM, atrial fib, and multiple past pneumonias admitted from [**Hospital1 **] with mental status change and hypotension.

#ID/sepsis Patient had fever and leukocytosis initially with fluctuating blood pressure, lactate 1.3. His blood pressure in the ED was measured on the left arm (which is typically much lower). His blood pressure on the right was found to be normal and pressors were off. Sputum culture was sent(colonized with pseudomonas), blood culture, urine culture and cath tip culture negative on discharge. His decubitus ulcer looks clean. His line was resited line to the right femoral. Chest CT was consistent with aspiration pneumonia. He will be continued on zosyn for 14 days. He remained afebrile and no pressors required throughout the rest of his hospital stay.

#Mental status changes: His mental status improved with decreasing CO2 and also with narcan. His CO2 remained well controlled in the hospital and was at baseline in 70s. CT head was negative. Narcotics was taken into consideration as possible cause of mental status changes. Patient's duragesic patch was removed in the ED.

#anemia/coagulation Patient has history of deep venous thrombosis with IVC filter and SVC clot and also atrial fibrillation for which he was on coumadin. COumadin was taken off 3 days prior to hospital admission because he had blood oozing from his trach and foley. In hospital, central line was attempted intially on the right subclavian but the artery was puctured. His right femoral artery was also punctured and he did lose a signifcant amount of blood. The 2 arterial puncture was tamponaded and there was no hematoma. He also got an ultrasound of uppper extremity which revealed DVT in left arm for which he was started on heparin drip. He then had mild guiac negative stool and oozing from arterial line site. Heparin drip was then stopped and he was given 2 unit of transfusion. His hematocrit had been stable since then. On discharge, coumadin was not restarted. It should be restarted in 1-2days time if the hematocrit remain stable. . #transaminitis He presented intially with transaminitis likely from hypotension. LFTS trended down on discharge. RUQ ultrasound was done which showed gallstone at neck of GB, no distension, thickened gallbladder. He remained afebrile and has no abdominal tenderness

#respiratory: Patient has squamous cell lung CA post right pneumonectomy and post tracheostomy. During his past admission there was concern about cuff leak and possible tracheomalacia. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended keeping the cuff pressures low with a cuff leak to prevent further tracheamalacia. Possible change the trach to a foam-filled trach ([**Last Name (un) 295**] tube) in the future if the cuff leak is interfering with the ability to ventilate. He remained on assist control ventilation. . # [**Name (NI) 300**] Pt with mildly elevated Na at 148. This is most likely due to water deficit as he can not drink to replace his needs. He recieved free water through G tube. . # Cardiac Patient has long history of atypical chest pain but has no such complain during this hospitalization. Cardiac enzymes were unremarkable. He was continued on aspirin and also amiodarone for atrial fibrillation. He is to avoid beta blockers and calcium channel blockers because of profound bradycardia. . #Type 2 diabetes mellitus Patient was continued on standing 8U glargine and sliding scale while in hospital.

#Anxiety/pain Patient's family reports that he is extemely anxious at baseline. He was continues on his outpatient doses of Haldol for anxiety 5mg hs, 2mg 8am/2pm, 1mg tid/prn, and paxil. His pain is from his scaral decubitus ulcer and back pain. Anxiety has been severely worsened in the past with ativan. Would avoid further ativan. Fentanyl patch was discontinued since there was a concern regarding narcotic overdose. He was on prn morphine. THis should be adjusted in [**Hospital1 **].

# Sacral Decubitus: He had Kinair bed

# FEN Tube feeds was continued with no residual

#access He had picc line on discharge

#code OK with pressor, do not resuscitate(confirmed again with family meeting)
