 Pertinent Results: [**2105-4-16**] 05:02PM   LACTATE-1.4 [**2105-4-16**] 04:23PM   GLUCOSE-116* UREA N-9 CREAT-0.7 SODIUM-139 POTASSIUM-4.2 CHLORIDE-106 TOTAL CO2-23 ANION GAP-14 [**2105-4-16**] 04:23PM   WBC-10.1# RBC-4.27 HGB-13.6 HCT-37.9 MCV-89 MCH-31.9 MCHC-36.0* RDW-13.1 [**2105-4-16**] 04:23PM   NEUTS-92.8* LYMPHS-4.1* MONOS-2.8 EOS-0 BASOS-0.2 [**2105-4-16**] 04:23PM   PLT COUNT-225 . Scope ENT (on admission): Her glottic opening is about 4mm on scope exam without symptoms including stridor or retraction. . CT neck with contrast ([**2105-4-16**]): Retropharyngeal fluid collection spanning from C2/3 to C5/6 with extensive surrounding edema and inflammation of the hypopharynx. The airway is narrowed to 4mm at the level of the hyoid. Patent cervical vasculature. . CXR ([**2105-4-17**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. No pathologic mediastinal widening. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Presence of minimal pleural effusions cannot be excluded. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. No pulmonary edema. . CT neck and chest w/ contrast ([**2105-4-18**]): 1. Interval slight decrease of the retropharyngeal fluid collection and improved airway patency. 2. No evidence of Lemierre's disease or new abscess formation.

3. No evidence of extension of the fluid collection into the mediastinum. No evidence of mediastinitis. . Chest CT ([**4-22**]): IMPRESSION: 1. Rapidly enlarging multiloculated right pleural effusion. This could be due to empyema considering clinical suspicion for this entity, but definitive diagnosis would require correlation with thoracentesis results. 2. Small dependent left pleural effusion has also increased in size since the prior study but does not have loculated components. 3. Slight increase in size of pre- and sub-carinal lymph nodes as well as right hilar nodes. These are likely reactive. 4. Ground-glass opacities in left upper lobe which are likely infectious or inflammatory in etiology. . TTE ([**4-22**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. . [**4-23**] CXR REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of the patient with complicated pleural effusion.

Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to [**2105-4-21**].

There is interval increase in right pleural effusion, loculated, better appreciated on the prior radiograph but the change in size is significant. No pneumothorax is seen. Left pleural effusion is unchanged. Bibasal areas of atelectasis are noted. . 5/28CXR

Discharge Labs . Micro.

Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):       HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE, BETA-LACTAMASE NEGATIVE.          BETA- LACTAMASE NEGATIVE: PRESUMPTIVELY SENSITIVE TO AMPICILLIN. .          BETA-LACTAMASE CONFIRMATION REQUESTED BY DR. [**Last Name (STitle) 2345**].

   Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2105-4-18**]):       Reported to and read back by DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2346**] ON [**2105-4-18**] AT 0720.       GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).

 Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo F with PMHX of HTN presenting with sore throat, neck pain, and odynophagia found to have epiglottis and retrophargyneal phlegmon. . #Epiglottis/retropharyngenal phlegmon: Diagnosed on CT neck and by ENT scope. Symptoms consistent with this. The patient did improve clinically with steroids, Ceftriaxone and clindamycin. The patient's airway was closely monitored in the ICU and underwent repeat ENT scoping on [**2105-4-18**] that showed ongoing arytenoid edema but completely patent airway. Repeat CT neck and chest with contrast, in the setting of ongoing posterior neck pain and inspiration pain as well as worsening erythematous lesion (see below), did not show Lemierre's or mediastinitis. There was minimal interval improvement in the phlegmon collection, however. Blood cultures from admission were positive for GNRs, later grew out HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE. Planned for 14 day course from day of first negative culture. The patient remained hemodynamically stable and re-evaluation by ENT in the ICU showed improved of supraglottic swelling so she was transfered to the floor. Repeat cultures were negative ???? HIV was sent and was negative. Patient continued to be symptom free on the floor and did not have any further airway complaints or problems. She was treated symptomatically with cepacol lozenges and was kept on a nicotine patch and received nebulizers PRN. . #Erythematous lesion: Patient developed a 3X3 inch erythematous lesion on her anterior chest, 2 inches below cricoid and poorly demarcated. The patient endorsed feeling warm and mildly tender to palpation in this area with no pruritis. No plaques/papules/bullae. The lesion was very blanching. Dermatology was consulted on [**2105-4-18**] given spread of this lesion to ~4X4 inches despite broadening to Vancomycin. Given the timing of her antibiotics, this lesion was not felt due to drug eruption, although a very early drug eruption can not be ruled out. The erythema was felt most consistent with a toxic exanthem, which is a vasodilation that occurs in patients with bactermia (more often staph, strep). Supportive care was provided. Derm followed patient while in house. by hospital day 4 the rash had significantly receeded. Derm did not feel compelled to biopsy - they thought it was likely due to her infectious process but did not represent a cellulitis. Her rash improved later in her hospital course. . #Pneumonia and pleural effusion: She was noted to have intermittent hypoxemia and R sided pleuritic chest pain on [**4-20**]. Medicine was consulted on [**4-22**], and in setting of new moderate pleural effusions R>L on CXR, recommended chest CT, which showed rapidly expanding and loculated effusion on R. She was then transferred to medicine, and ID was consulted. Her antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone. Her pleural effusion was attempted to be drained by IR, but they only withdrew 30 cc of fluid, given loculation. Thoracic surgery was then involved and carried out a VATS procedure which was uncomplicated and the patient was transferred back to medicine. . #Hypertension: Blood pressures normal and intermittently high (SBPs 150s) in-house. The patient's atenolol, lipitor were held in the setting of epiglottis/retropharyngeal phlegmon but restarted once she was able to tolerate POs. Atenolol was initially started at half home dose 50mg, then back to her full dose.However due to asymp. bradycardia into the 40's atenolol was discontinued ad replaced with Chlorthalidone on [**4-25**]. . # Intermittent bradycardia to 40s, asymptomatic: She was monitored on telemetry with occasional intermittent bradycardia to the 40s. her EKG was otherwise normal, without AVB. TTE was done which showed no HD significant pericardial effusion, abscess, or vegetations. Her bradycardia may have been due to vagal tone in setting of pleural effusions and pleuritic pain. . # Lower extremity edema: She noted increased edema during this admission. She had some baseline edema as a flight attendant but only while standing for long durations. She had no JVD or HJR, and TTE was normal. . #PPX: Heparin sq #Full Code, confirmed.
