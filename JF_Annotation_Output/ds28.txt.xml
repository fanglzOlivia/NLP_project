Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2074**] Chief Complaint: Direct transfer from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital for STEMI, cath and now stablized hct and transfered out of CCU

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization Blood transfusion

History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 2391**] is a 66-year-old male with hx HIV on HAART, lymphoma, LUL lung adenocarcinoma s/p resection, hx CAD s/p PCI with DES in [**5-17**] to proximal circumflex artery. In [**11-16**] he had elective cath showing 90% restenosis at proximal edge of previously placed stent, treated with overlapping Cyper stent. Mid-RCA was 80% occluded and treated with DES as well. In [**2-18**] pt had a left femoral artery to dorsalis pedis artery bypass graft with an in situ greater saphenous vein graft. His plavix was discontinued at that time. He was recently admitted on [**2188-4-30**] w/ STEMI over III, F, taken to cath, where he had a DES placed in the LCX for the vessel being occluded by a thrombus proximally. Of note, at cath [**4-30**], he had a totally occluded right external iliac artery. The pt was discharged home [**2188-5-3**]. Since that time, per the pt, he felt at baseline, with the exception of intermittent left leg pain (s/p vascular surgery, bypass) that would occasionally awaken him at night. He stated he was up this morning at 4am b/c of this left leg pain, when he developed a "cold rough" feeling in his esophagus similar to his pain that he had with all of his prior MIs. He states it was a [**5-24**] in severity. He took 1 nitro, and it resolved. He reports he did not take his plavix yesterday and today. He noted intermittent right sided chest pain as well last night, which felt like "gas pain", + SOB, no diaphoresis, + nausea, no vomiting. He states the feeling returned and then persisted, took a 2nd nitro but it only decreased the pain to a [**2192-2-16**]. He called 911. . In the ambulance, the pt's pain decr to [**1-25**] and he received ASA, another nitro en route. His pain, however, only resolved completely on nitro gtt at OSH where he was given ASA, IV integrillin, IV heparin, started on nitro drip with full resolution of pain, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath. His initial BP at OSH 130/75, down to 93/63 after nitro. Outside labs with CK 60, other ezymes pending at time of transfer, BNP 17. . At [**Hospital1 18**], he was given plavix 600mg load prior to cath. In the cath lab: LCX was totally occluded within proximal stents. A wire was passed and flow was reestablished (likely development of blood clots). 1 additional bare metal stent (no DES since he had questionable compliance w/ plavix) placed distal to last stent. Some non-occluding stenosis in the distal branches. Cath was performed via radial artery (per lower ext arterial disease). His right groin (femoral vein) developed a hematoma. His left groin was not accessed given his c/o left leg pain post surgery 2 months ago. He was subsequently transferred to the floor. He then had BP drop to 90s/40s-50s and a pm HCT was found to be 27.7 (6 point drop from pre-cath HCT). He is being transferred to the CCU for unstable HCT and hematoma with labile BP s/p catheterization today. . Brief CCU event: CT scan of abd neg for RP bleed. Neg groin for psuedoaneurysm. Stable hct. Received total of 3 units of blood. 2 unit pRBC for hct 27 ([**5-9**]) -> 31.6 ([**5-10**] Am)-> 29.5-> 28.2 ([**5-10**] 1pm)->32.3 ([**5-10**] 12pm)-> 31.8 ([**5-11**] 4am)

 Past Medical History: S/p left VATS and wedge biopsy of the left upper lobe [**4-18**] for adenocarcinoma. Non-hodgkins lung lymphoma HIV CAD Bladder Ca, s/p resection S/p bowel resection Claudication

 Pertinent Results: CATH [**2188-5-9**] LMCA: nl LAD: 50% mid disease LCX: Total occlusion within proximal stents RCA: not injected Abdominal aortography: mild left common femoral disease. femoral graft patent with no signficant disease seen in graft or native vessels to above the knee. Intervention: Successful treatment of IPMI with BMS. Using right radial approach, LCA engaged with AL2 guide. Stent occlusion crossed with wire and bballoon with restoration of flow showing progressed diesase to 80% just distal to stents. PTCA with suboptimal result so 2.5X18 minivision stent placed into larger upper pole which had multiple moderate lesions. prior stents redilated with 3.0 balloon. No residual, normal flow in all branches. .  92 7.0 \ 9.4 / 325      -----      27.7 . 136  103  23 / 199    AGap=16 ------------- 4.3  21  0.8 \ CK: 60  91 5.7 \ 11.4 / 338     --------       33.6  N:63.7 L:30.4 M:3.6 E:1.8 Bas:0.5 PT: 18.1  PTT: 150  INR: 1.7



Brief Hospital Course: 66 year old male with HIV, CAD, recently admitted for STEMI found to have 100% LCX lesion and stented w/ DES, who presented with STEMI to OSH, and found to have total occlusion of proximal LCX stent, now s/p bare metal stent placement. Pt was then found to have a hematocrit drop and hypotension necessitating transfuse to CCU, now stabilized. . Blood loss: Pt was s/p catheterization with R wrist for arterial access and R groin for venous access. CT scan was performed, and ruled out RP bleed and U/S ruled out AV fistula and pseudoaneurysm. He received a total of 3 units PRBCs in CCU, and his hct has been stable. Pt likely had blood loss during cath, and in groin hematoma. After being transferred back to the floor from the CCU, his Hct was stable. Low-dose metoprolol was started the night before discharge, and he tolerated this with SBP in the 100s to 110s. . Cardiac. Patient was admitted with a repeat STEMI secondary to instent thrombosis. He had placement of a bare metal stent, and was started on higher doses of plavix at 150 mg daily. He was continued on aspirin and a high dose statin as well. His antihypertensives were held due to hypotension, and restarted prior to discharge. He was not diuresed further, despite an elevated PCWP of 28 at catheterization, due to hypotension. He remained in normal sinus rhythm. . Hyperbilirubinemia: the pt was noted to have mild jaundice and scleral icterus on [**5-12**]. LFTs were checked and his total bilirubin was 6.6, direct bili was 0.2. His other LFTs were normal. His hemolysis labs were normal. The hyperbilirubinemia was felt to be most likely due to either reabsorption of the large hematoma or a side effect from one of his HIV meds, most likely atazanavir. His bilirubin continued to climb but he was otherwise asymptomatic. A RUQ U/S showed small gallstones but no evidence of cholecystitis or obstruction. His statin and HIV meds were stopped on discharge. . HIV: Patient was continued on his outpatient HIV medications. He was continued on prophylactic bactrim. He was continued on his antidepressants. . Dispo. Patient was discharged to home with a stable hematocrit.
