She was recently treated for cellulitis in that leg with vancomycin on previous hospitalization in [**2194-1-28**]. After two days of vancomycin, she had marked improvement in the leg with decreased erythema in color and was dramatically receeding from the marked border below the area. There was still [**12-1**]+pitting edema in the left thigh, but improved compared to admission when it was harder and was obscuring the anatomical markings of the knee on extension. LENI of the leg was negative for DVT.  She was seen by vascular surgery during this admission, who did not feel that surgery was indicated and agreed with the proposed medical management. -Vancomycin dosed with HD x 2 weeks (last day [**4-28**]) -Ciprofloxacin 500mg po qday x 2 weeks (last day [**4-28**]) . #Hypotension - patient hypotensive to SBPs in 80s. In the ED there was concern that she was possibly septic, so she was admited to the ICU. She received 1.5L of IV fluids and her BP repsonded well. Her baseline blood pressure is in the low 90s systolic.  After being on the floor she continued to have lower blood pressures and was asymptomatic with them. -She will require monitoring of her blood pressure during [**Month/Year (2) 2286**] sessions . # Afib - on amiodarone and coumadin as outpatient.  Stable.  INR therapeutic at 2.1 on admission.  Continued on home medications - cont warfarin and amiodarone . # CAD - Continued on amiodarone, pravastatin and SLNGT . # COPD - on spiriva, alubterol and fluticasone at home.

Has had cough for the past [**3-6**] weeks and recently started on doxycycline on [**4-10**], which was continued for planned 7 day course total and will be completed on [**4-16**].  No worsening SOB.  CXR showed no evidence of PNA . # chronic sytolic CHF - Continued on home furosemide dose. Patinet is not on ACEI prior to this admission, and this was not started given her hypotension. . # ESRD - Continued on HD schedule of T-TH-SAT. She received an extra ultrafiltration session on [**4-17**] (friday) to try to remove more fluid from her left leg. .
