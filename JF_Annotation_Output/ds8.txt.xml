Pertinent Results: [**2118-8-10**] 02:09PM   GLUCOSE-161* UREA N-10 CREAT-0.8 SODIUM-142 POTASSIUM-3.9 CHLORIDE-105 TOTAL CO2-28 ANION GAP-13 [**2118-8-10**] 02:09PM   WBC-12.2*# RBC-4.03* HGB-11.5* HCT-34.5* MCV-86 MCH-28.4 MCHC-33.2 RDW-13.3

Pathology Report from [**2118-8-10**]: DIAGNOSIS: 1.  Brain, left frontal (A):     1.  Vascular malformation consistent with arteriovenous malformation     of cortical [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter with radiation induced fibrinoid     necrosis.     2.  Focal hemosiderin deposition suggesting prior hemorrhages. 2.  Left frontal radionecrosis and residual AVM (B):     1.  Vascular malformation consistent with arteriovenous malformation     of cortical [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter with radiation induced fibrinoid     necrosis.     2.  Focal hemosiderin deposition suggesting prior hemorrhages. Clinical:  Radionecrosis.

CT Head post-op [**8-10**]: FINDINGS: There is a left-sided frontal craniotomy with surgical resection of the enhancing "mass" noted in previous studies. There is extensive confluent hypodensity in the left frontoparietal region, that likely represents post-radiation vasogenic edema with resultant 8.5-mm shift of normally-midline structures, not significantly changed from the previous MR. There is a tiny focus of hyperdensity in the postoperative field which may represent a small amount of hemorrhage. There is expost-operative pneumocephalus and subcutaneous air noted.

IMPRESSION: Status post left craniotomy and resection of AVM and possible "mass"-like radiation necrosis, with small hyperdense focus in the operative bed, likely representing very small hemorrhage. Extensive vasogenic edema persists.



 Brief Hospital Course: Post-operatively she was admitted to the ICU for observation s/p resection. Her Post-op head CT was negative for bleeding. She remained intubated immediately post-op. She was weaned and extubated on [**8-11**] and did very well neurologically. The patient was transferred out of the ICU later that day. She was ambulating without difficulty, her pain was well-controlled, and she was taking in food with no nausea/vomiting. Her post-operative MRI was done on [**8-12**] and showed expected post-operative changes. She was discharged on [**2118-8-12**].
