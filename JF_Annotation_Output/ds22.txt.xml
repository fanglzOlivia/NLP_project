Patient reports that she has been feeling weak over the last 3 weeks with an unintentional 10 lb weight loss (of note over the last 2 months she has lost 20lbs).  1 week ago she started feeling SOB with exertion, and "hot and cold" but no fevers chills.

HIV-1 Viral Load/Ultrasensitive (Final [**2190-2-15**]): 114,000 copies/ml.

Micro: Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) (Final [**2190-2-12**]): POSITIVE FOR PNEUMOCYSTIS JIROVECII (CARINII).

 CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2190-2-11**] 10:44 AM IMPRESSION: Diffuse hazy opacities within both lungs, without evidence for volume overload. Findings are most concerning for a diffuse infectious process, likely with atypical organisms. If the patient is immunocompromised, PCP should be considered.

 Brief Hospital Course: On admission there was high index of suspicion for PCP given the appearance on chest x-ray and a significant amount of oropharyngeal thrush. Bronchoscopy with BAL on [**2190-2-12**] was positive for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was presumptively started on Bactrim and Prednisone treatment in the emergency department. She was consented for HIV testing and it came back positive with a viral load (VL) of 114,000 and a CD4 of 8. Her oxygenation was tenuous initially requiring face mask with desaturation to the high 70 with movement to the commode but she did not require intubation. Over the course of her treatment she was transition ed to face tent and eventually to 4-5 L of oxygen via nasal cannula. Her overall oxygenation minimally improved very slowly despite Bactrim with a prolonged steroid taper. She was finally discharged home with O2 supplementation of [**3-2**] L to keep O2 sat at 94 % at rest. Her hypoxia was related to the PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**]. For confirmation, she underwent CTA of the lung which was negative for pulmonary embolism. The CT did show diffuse ground glass opacities as well as lymphadenopathy without effusions consistent with the diagnosis of PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 2321**] her exertional hypoxia, she remained well with minimal symptoms (only mild dyspnea with activity but no significant cough and no fever or chest pain). Patient remained in the hospital for several extra days hoping that her hypoxia will improve. It did remain stable at the above level without any additional symptoms (4-5 L at rest with O2 sat at 94 with decrease to 87-85 with activity. Without oxygen, her O2 sat will decrease to 76 with activity). In regards to the new diagnosis of AIDS(AIDS defining illness and CD4 of 8), her toxoplasma IgG was positive. She was started on azithromycin for [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis. ID was consulted and will follow her closely as an outpatient ( 3 days after discharge). HIV genotyping was sent and was pending at the time of discharge. The patient has a history of hypertension and was continued on home dose of Atenolol 50 mg daily.  BP was well controlled despite holding amlodipine/chlorthalidone and these were NOT restarted on discharge. She did have elevation of her liver function tests on presentation. Work up included negative hepatitis serologies and RUQ ultrasound (mild fatty infiltration). LFTs abnormalities were related to PCP pneumonia, fatty liver, or both. Blood AFB culture and HCV viral loads are pending and will be followed by her ID. She was discharged home without VNA, the latter would offer little help as she had no to minimal symptoms. Total discharge time 56 minutes.

Medications on Admission: amlodipine 10 mg daily atenolol-chlorthalidone 100 mg-25 mg 0.5 tablet daily calcium carbonate-vitamin D3 500 mg (1,250 mg)-400 unit [**Hospital1 **]

 Discharge Disposition: Home

Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: PCP Pneumonia HIV/AIDS

Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.  (requiring supplemental O2)

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath and were found to have a severe pneumonia from an organism called PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] have been treated with antibiotics and prednisone. Your immune system is suppressed by HIV/AIDS and you will need to be followed closely by the infectious disease team. You have a very low oxygen in your blood from the severe inflammation related to the PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**]. This may take several days to weeks to improve. Please increase your activity as much as possible to avoid clots formation in legs or lung. You requested discharge home. . Please note the following changes to your medication regimen:
