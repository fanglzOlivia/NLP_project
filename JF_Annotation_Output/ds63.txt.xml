Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 2072**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from an OSH for ACS.

1. CAD/ACS. OSH reported ECG with ST depressions in V2-V5/Elevation in III and negative CE??????s. Admitted with ACS and sent directly to cath. TNTs drawn post cath and positive, but trended down ([**12-20**] PCI?). CK??????s were flat. Thus, was unclear where to place pt on spectrum of UA --> STEMI. Card Cath revealed: R dom. 3VD. LMCA widely patent. LAD 50% at ostium. LCX 70% mid lesion (before OM1. RCA long 70% lesion (before bifurcation off the PDA and posterolateral branch). RCA Drug-Eluting Stent was placed and it was deemed the patient should be evaluated for CABG at a future date. Of note, after cath, the patient was extremely sleepy and had RR of 8. He was sent to the ICU for monitoring, but was lucid and stable within 8-10 hrs. His sleepiness was attributed to the large amount of sedatives, opioids that he received at the OSH and intracath. He was not given Narcan. He was stable and CP free for the remainder of his admission. Continuous telemetry monitoring revealed SR (50s-70s). Pt was continued on Atorvastatin 80 mg PO QD (incr from 40), Clopidogrel Bisulfate 75 mg PO QD, Lisinopril 20 mg PO QD (incr from 10mg), Aspirin EC 325 mg PO QD. Diltiazem was DCed. Outpatient ECHO was recommended to eval for any HK segments.

2. HTN. SBPs 90s-120s. Continued on meds as above plus Isosorbide Mononitrate (Extended Release) 30 mg PO QD. SBPs in 90s were likely related to opioid admin.

3. GERD. Continue Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q24H. No symptoms now.

4. FEN. Cards healthy diet.

5. PPx. Colace/Senna. SubQ Hep.

6. Dispo. DCed to home after being cleared by PT.
