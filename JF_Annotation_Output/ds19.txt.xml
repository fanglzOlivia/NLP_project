Brief Hospital Course: On [**2130-2-3**] Mr. [**Known lastname 2302**] was admitted to the surgery service under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with the diagnosis of a lower GI bleed. His initial Hct was 28 and initial INR was 15. He was admitted to the ICU and resuscitated. He was transfused 2 units of PRBCs for a Hct of 22, and 2 units of FFP to reverse his anticoagulation. He was also given Vitamin K. The following day he was transfused 4 more units of PRBCs. The GI service was consulted and 2 attempts were made to do a colonoscopy. Both attempts were aborted due to a poor preparation. After 3 days in the ICU, Mr. [**Known lastname 2303**] Hct was stable at 26-27. He was transferred to the floor and given 1 more unit of PRBCs for borderline urine output. His Hct then stabilized at 28-29. Since he had no more episodes of bloody bowel movements, it was felt that there was no need to make further attempts at colonoscopy. His diet was then slowly advanced, physical therapy evaluated the patient, and he was discharged to rehab on HD 7. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1940**] from GI as well as his PCP regarding his coumadin dose and INR checks.
