History of Present Illness: 64 yo AA male with HIV/AIDS (VL: 570; CD4: 251 on [**11-27**]'[**48**] currently treated with Combivir and Bactrim SS Mon, Wed, Fri for ppx as well as a flu shot for [**2147**]-[**2148**]) and COPD on home oxygen (FEV1/FVC: 34%; FEV1 26%; FVC: 77%) comes in with dyspnea for 6 days. The pt reports development of sob similar to his previous episodes of COPD/PNA. 2-3days ago, he subsequently developed cough productive of yellow-green sputum along with subjective fevers, chills, and diaphoresis. He also developed some pleuritic chest pain several days ago. The chest pain was located in the left side of the chest below the nipple line and occurred with deep inspiration. The pt reports these are all similar to previous episodes of COPD exacerbation. The pt had tried nebulizers Q4hours in addition to 2L NC one day PTA without any improvement. The pt uses oxygen at home 40% of the time, mostly when he is active. The pt noted inc. DOE even with the oxygen prior to this episode. The pt does admit to one episode of vomiting in the ED, which was thought to be secondary to meds he received in the ED. The pt denies HA, abd pain, diarrhea.

 In the ED, the pt was febrile to 101 rectally, requiring 5liters oxygen to keep sats >96%. He was given ceftriaxone, azithromycin, bactrim and solumedrol with continuouos nebs for PNA vs. COPD flare. He had one episode of emesis in ED. The pt also received a CTA which ruled out a PE (given the concern for pleuritic chest pain). ABG in the ED was: 7.44/40/81--> 7.49/40/67. The pt reports improvement in his sob after receiving solumedrol and nebs in the ED.
