Date of Birth:  [**2123-12-24**]             Sex:   F

Service: MEDICINE

Allergies: Atorvastatin / Penicillins / Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2265**] Chief Complaint: SOB, decreased urine

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Hemodialysis Placement of a R IJ catheter Placement of a R subclavian tunneled dialysis line

 History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 2251**] is a 70yoF with h/o dilated cardiomyopathy [**1-1**] aortic outflow obstruction, AICD s/p VT, CAD, COPD (on home O2) who presented with decreased UO and SOB, now transferred from medicine service to CCU for hypotension. Pt is currently somnolent and unable to provide a detailed history, so details are obtained from OMR and Atrius records.  Pt saw NP in complex care clinic on [**7-10**], at that time felt well overall, c/o dry cough but denied SOB, peripheral edema. At that time her weight was recorded at 185 lbs (dry weight is estimated at 184 lbs). On [**7-17**] she called the CCC office c/o minimal urine output ("only drops") and cough productive of yellow sputum.  She reported compliance with her home diuretic regimen, but [**Name8 (MD) **] NP note she had not filled her aldactone rx. . On DOA, she called EMS due to increasing SOB.  When EMS arrived her SBP was 80.  She received 250cc NS and was brought to ED. In ED she had SBP 90s so received another 500cc NS bolus. CXR showed no e/o infiltrate but she was treated empirically for CAP with 1g ceftriaxone given her recent productive cough. Labs were significant for Na 121 and Cr 5.4 (baseline 3.5-4.0). She was admitted to medicine service.  On the floor, her BP was initially 98/65 but then decreased to SBP 70s.  She was transferred to CCU for pressor support. . On transfer, vitals were T 95.7, HR 60 (v-paced), BP 110/56, RR 18, O2sat 100% on 2LNC.  She was drowsy, but denied current SOB, chest pain, palpitations, LE swelling.  She endorsed orthopnea (c/w baseline) cough productive of yellow sputum, nausea, RUQ discomfort, and anuria. Denied recent fevers/chills, diarrhea/constipation, melena/hematochezia, BRBPR. . Of note she was admitted 1 month ago (from [**Date range (1) 2266**]) for CHF exacerbation and hypervolemia. She was started on a lasix drip with metolazone but was ultimately started on ultrafiltration with a tunneled HD line which she tolerated well. She has not required outpatient HD since discharge.

Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Admission 70yoF with h/o dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 35%), AICD p/w SOB and poor urine output for several days found to have hyponatremia, now transferred from medicine to CCU due to hypotension. . Active Issues: . #Acute on chronic systolic heart failure:  The patient was hypervolemic on exam with elevated JVP and increased abdominal distension at presentation.  Given the patient had been refractory to diuretic therapy requiring ultrafiltration during her last hospitalization and was oliguric and hyponatremic on admission, ultrafiltration was initiated rather than diuretic therapy. She experienced significant muscle cramping and hypotension while on CVVHD requiring dopamine. CVVHD was discontinued on HD#2 and she was diuresed with IV lasix and metolazone. Pressures improved and she was weaned off of dopamine.  It was noted that urine and blood pressure improved when the patient was in her native sinus rhythm with asynchronous ventricular pacing.  Therefore the patients pacemaker escape rate was lowered to allow for increased native rhythm and the mode was changed to AAIR.  Despite this change urine output remained poor and she was therefore started on a lasix drip ultimately requiring milrinone to augment diuresis. On HD#6 patient underwent placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter, and on HD#7 she continued HD using the tunneled line (see below). Lasix and metolazone were discontinued as patient will be HD dependent. . #Hypotension:  Patient was hypotensive on admission in the setting of volume overload.  Her hypotension was believed to be due to worsening cardiac output in setting of dilated cardiomyopathy. She was temporarily on a dopamine gtt, but this was weaned by HD#2.  In addition, she experienced episodes of hypotension with CVVH with diuresis and antihypertensive medications, so her antihypertensive medications were held. On discharge, her BP was stable.  She was asked to continue to hold her carvedilol and to follow up with her PCP about restarting as tolerated. . # Hyponatremia: Pts sodium was 119 on admission and likely cause of her AMS, thought to be hypervolemic hyponatremia with poor renal perfusion given e/o volume overload on exam and low urine Na. Her fluid intake was restricted to 1.5L daily, and she started CVVH as above with improvement in her hyponatremia as well as her mental status.  At the time of discharge her sodium was 135. . # Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient was noted to have a creat of 5.4, baseline 3.5-4.0, and oliguria x 2-3 days on admission. As stated above she had previously required ultrafiltration during hospitalizations for heart failure exacerbation.  Renal was consulted and felt that the patient would require chronic HD.  Given her hypotension she was initally started on CVVH with dopamine gtt for pressure support.  However as above she did not tolerate CVVH and it was discontinued.  She was diuresed with lasix gtt and milrinone as above until she had her tunneled line placed on HD#6.  She tolerated HD well, with stable BP and no muscle cramping. Outpatient dialysis was arranged with [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **] Dialysis Center for mondays, wednesdays and fridays. . # Afib: Pt has a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin at home.  On admission her coumadin was held in preparation for placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter. As stated above her pacemaker settings were changed and she was in sinus rhythm for most of her CCU course with heart rates in the 50-70s.  Her mode was changed to AAIR to allow for intrinsice AV conduction and minimize ventricular pacing in an abnormal heart. Her coumadin was restarted at her home dose on HD#7.  Her INR at the time of discharge was 1.4.

# Stable issues: . # COPD: Patient's recent cough and SOB with h/o COPD was initially c/f COPD exacerbation, and she was initially started on prednisone and levofloxacin. However there was no wheezing on exam therefore prednisone and antibiotics were discontinued. She was continued on her home albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer treatments, and maintained O2 sats >90% on 2L NC (her baseline O2 requirement). . # CAD: Stable, no c/o chest pain during hospitalization.  She was continued on her home ASA and pravastatin. . # HTN: Carvedilol was discontinued due to frequent episodes of hypotension (with SBP 70s-80s).  She can resume as an outpatient if BP tolerates. . # Gout: Patient was continued on her home allopurinol and did not have any pain concerning for a gout flare. . # Transitional issues: - Patient maintained full code status throughout hospitalization. - She will continue outpatient hemodialysis at [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **] Dialysis Center - She has follow-up scheduled with her PCP and her cardiologist.  She will be contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding a follow-up appointment with the device clinic in 3 months.

 Discharge Disposition: Home With Service

Facility: [**Hospital 2255**] [**Name (NI) 2256**]

Discharge Diagnosis: Chronic Renal Failure Acute on Chronic systolic CHF Atrial Fibrillation Coronary Artery Disease Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Hypertension Gout

 Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane).

 Discharge Instructions: It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were in the hospital.

You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath and not making urine. Your heart was not pumping well which caused you to have extra fluid.  We gave you medication to help you to urinate out this fluid however your kidneys were not working properly and you needed dialysis to do the job of your kidneys. You got a special IV to be used for dialysis. You will need to continue going to dialysis three times a week. Your blood pressure was also so low so we did not give you your home blood pressure medications while you were in the hospital.

You should continue to go to dialysis three times a week.  You were also started on a medication called nephrocaps that you will need to continue.

You should stop taking your carvedilol, metolazone, spironolactone and lasix unless your doctor instructs you to restart these medications.

Continue your coumadin and amiodarone for your abnormal heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation).  Continue your aspirin and pravastatin for your heart disease, your allopurinol for your gout, your albuterol and ipratropium for your COPD.
