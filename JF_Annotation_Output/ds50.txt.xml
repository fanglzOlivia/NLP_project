 Social History: The patient lives alone and has VNA help.  She denies etoh and smoking, and for ambulation wears a back support corset(belt), compression stocking and uses a walker.  She is on 2L home oxygen

 Family History: NC

Physical Exam: Vitals: T:97.3 BP:105/37 HR:88 RR:21 O2Sat:96% on RA GEN: Well-appearing, well-nourished, no acute distress HEENT: EOMI, pale conjunctiva, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, dry MM, OP Clear NECK: No JVD, carotid pulses brisk, no bruits, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: RRR, 3/6 systolic murmur, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: Lungs CTAB ABD: Soft, Superficial subcutaneous firm area, NT, ND, +BS, no HSM, EXT: No peripheral oedema.

 Pertinent Results: Laboratories: Notable for Hematocrit of 22 down from baseline 30, WBC 22.5, and creatinine 3.9 up from baseline 1.4. See below for rest. . ECG:  Sinus rhythm at 76 bpm with evidence of RVH, normal axis and intervals, no ST-T changes. . Imaging: [**2136-4-4**] Chest x-ray: FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained. Evaluation is somewhat limited by underpenetrated technique. There is no definite evidence of pneumonia. Heart size is stable. Pulmonary arterial prominence is noted compatible with patient's given history of pulmonary hypertension. Atherosclerotic calcification at the aorta is noted. There is no pneumothorax. Diffuse demineralized bone is noted with post-surgical changes of the right proximal humerus. . Abdominal CT:Large right rectus muscle hematoma approximately 10.1x4.4x15.2 cm. . Echocardiogram on [**2136-3-26**]: The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2). The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course: This is a 84 year-old female with a history of pulmonary hypertension, diastolic CHF, who presented with weakness, hypotension, Guaiac positive stools. .

# Hypotension - Her hypotension and anemia were felt to be due to blood loss from rectus sheath hematoma.  Unknown exactly how the hematoma occurred (?secondary to heparin injection while recently hospitalized)but was well visualized on the abdominal CT that she had in the ER.  She was evaluated by GI (due to anemia and guaiac positive stools), who found external hemorrhoids on exam and stated there was little or no concern regarding duodenal angioectasia as source of hematocrit drop. They followed and plans for c-scope if she started bleeding again.   Her Hct was 22 on admission, microcytic.  She received 3 units of blood in total and her hematocrit stablized at 29-30 for several days.  Her blood pressure was 80/40 on admission and she was admitted to the MICU, but did not require pressors, her BP increased with blood and fluids (2L).  In the ICU she was on a po PPI, had two large bore IVs, as well as central access. Her Hct was checked q6 hours and transfusion parameter was 26. Her aspirin was held.  Her BP increased to teens over 80's and she was transferred to the medical floor after one day in the MICU.  On the medical floor her blood pressure remained in the 120's/80's initially but then increased to 140's.  Her lisinopril, valsartan, metoprolol and furosemide were held initially due to her relatively low blood pressure and increased creatinine (see below). Her furosemide was restarted on the last day of hospitalization due to blood pressure that would tolerate it and signs of hypervolemia. In addition she had several bowel movements on the day prior to admission, likely due to many laxatives she was receiving.  She did not have a  leukocytosis, fever.  The stool was guiaic negative.  Her laxatives were discontinued except docusate. . # Acute renal failure - Pre-renal secondary to hypotension/hypovolemia.  C Her electrolytes and volume status were stable.  Her lisinopril, lasix and valsartan were held and continue to be held as her blood pressure is in the 130's.  Her creatinine was 3.4 on admission with a baseline of 1.6.  Her creatinine decreased to 1.4 after hydration and her lasix was restarted at her home dose of 80mg po bid. . # Leukocytosis - WBC on admission was very high, likely reactive, given hypotension, and acute blood loss.  Blood and urine cultures were negative and she had no diarrhea.  Her CXR was unremarkable and antibiotics were deferred as there was no source of infection, she was afebrile and her leukocytosis resolved (WBC was 7 for the last two days of admission). . # Hyperlipidemia - She continued to take atorvastatin . # Chronic pain - She continued to take gabapentin . # Diabetes mellitus - insulin sliding scale while in house, once creatinine normalized glipizide 2.5mg q daily was re-started. . # Psych - Continued paroxetine . # PPx:  She had pneumoboots . # Code:  Full code . # Comm:  [**Name (NI) 1961**],[**Name (NI) **] (Son) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1976**]

 Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with low blood pressure, anemia.  You were treated in the medical intensive care unit.  You received blood transfusions and IV fluids.  You were evaluated by the gastroenterologists that felt that your low blood count was due to the collection of blood in your abdominal wall and possibly some bleeding from your small intestine.  You blood counts remained stable and your blood pressure improved.  You were transferred to the medical floor where you remained stable. Physical therapy evaluated you, worked with you. . Please continue to take your medication as prescribed.  You should call your doctor if you feel weak, dizzy, have abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, black or red stool. . It is important that you follow up as outlined below.
