 Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 64 yo man s/p lung ca s/p pneumonectomy and severe COPD here after prolonged admission for respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy placement here with new left sided chest pain. . 1. Chest pain: Multiple sets of cardiac enzymes were cycled and CK/MB remained flat while troponin increased slightly and then remained stable at 0.12.  Repeat EKGs showed no changes. Cardiology was consulted and agreed that there was no evidence of an acute ischemic event.  Pt was continued on ASA.  The pt's chest pain may be related to his chronic SVC syndrome. . 2. Respiratory Failure: Pt on a prolonged ventilator wean secondary to COPD, pneumonectomy, lung cancer and hx of recurrent pneumonias.  Pt was continued on AC at night and pressure support during the day.  He will continued to wean at rehab. . 3. Bilateral upper extremety swelling: This has been chronic since last admission w/o evidence of DVT.  Pt had another CTA in the ER that showed no PE but did show a narrowing of the SVC. Interventional radiology placed a stent in the SVC and over the next several days, the pt's upper ext swelling improved. . 4. Atrial fibrillation: Pt remained in normal sinus rhythm for most of the hospital stay except for a brief episode of a fib with rapid ventricular rate which resolved on its own.  Pt was continued on his coumadin. . 5. Anxiety: Pt has a long history of anxiety controlled on fentanyl, morphine prn, haldol. AVOID benzos as pt has paradoxical response. * 6. Anemia: Likely secondary to chronic disease- baseline around 28.  Iron studies were sent and revealed a low iron with normal TIBC, ferritin.  He was transfused once to [**Last Name (un) 291**] hct>30. . 7. DM type 2: Pt's glucose was controlled with glargine and an insulin sliding scale. . 8. Access: A PICC line was placed by IR when pt was having his SVC stented.  If this line is not needed, it should be pulled to decrease infection risk.  It was placed on [**2179-2-4**].
