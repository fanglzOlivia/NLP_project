 History of Present Illness: A [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, recent admission [**Date range (1) 2374**] for acute on chronic renal failure with decision to initiate hemodialysis at that time and hospital stay complicated by left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia presenting with altered mental status.  Per her daughter, the patient was home this past week and accidentally took trazodone 50 mg two days prior to admission, which had been discontinued due to confusion.  Her confusion/visual hallucinations improved the day prior to admission.  She complained of increased productive cough and oxygen requirement (previously intermittent 2L NC, now continuous) over the past two days, responding to an increase in nebulizer treatments.  The patient was noted to be lethargic this afternoon, responsive to sternal rub.  When aroused, she was oriented x 3 and moving all extremities well, however.  The patient was noted to be "cold."  She has not complained of recent fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, erythema around line. . In the ED, initial VS T 96, HR 63, BP 77/55, RR 18 SaO2 98% (oxygen not documented).  Per report, patient had poor respiratory effort, became apneic, and was subsequently intubated.  Chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and left lower lobe pneumonia.  Head CT negative for acute process.  A right femoral line was placed for access.  She was given etomidate and roccuronium for intubation, vancomycin 1 gm IV x 1, zosyn 4.5 gm IV x 1, 1L NS.  The patient was started on levophed for hypotension peri-intubation, off within half an hour. . On arrival to the MICU, she is responsive to tactile stimuli.

MICRO: [**2131-12-24**] Sputum Culture:  MORAXELLA CATARRHALIS.    MODERATE GROWTH.

Studies: [**2131-12-28**] CT CHEST: 1. Simple bilateral pleural effusions are moderate on the left and small on the right. No definite underlying consolidation is seen. 2. Recommend three-month followup for right apex lesion with internal calcification, which may represent scarring, although underlying neoplastic process cannot be excluded. 3. Moderate-to-severe coronary artery atherosclerosis is most prominent in the left anterior descending artery. 4. Small pericardial effusion causes no mass effect. 5. Splenic hypodensity is not well characterized and ultrasound may be obtained for evaluation if clinically indicated. 6. Moderate emphysema.

[**2131-12-23**] CXR: Bibasal effusions with a pneumonic consolidation in the left lower lobe. Please ensure followup to clearance.

[**2131-12-23**] CT HEAD: 1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. 2. Left frontal encephalomalacia with probable slight further involution. 3. Left maxillary sinus disease.

 Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 46**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with past medical history of COPD, Wegener's granulomatosis with resulting chronic kidney disease, recent admission [**Date range (3) 2374**] for acute on chronic renal failure, started on hemodialysis w/hospital stay c/b left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia admitted with recurrant moraxella pneumonia and sepsis.

1)Moraxella pneumonia: Most likely explanation for respiratory failure/hypotension in ED requiring intubation.  She was successfully extubated on [**12-25**] and maintaining O2 sats on O2 via NC without e/o respiratory distress.  Her sputum culture from [**2131-12-24**] is again growing Moraxella, no other new organisms.  CXR continues to show same LLL infiltrate concerning for partially treated pneumonia.  Concerning for endobronchial lesion with postobstructive pneumonia however chest CT did not show any underlying structural cause for recurrance of pneumonia.  She did have bilateral pleural effusions which appeared simple and did not appear to be parapneumonic.  She was initially treated with vancomycin and zosyn however this was changed to ceftriaxone once culture data returned with moraxella.  She improved daily from a repiratory standpoint and was on minimal to no oxygen on discharge.  She was changed to cefpodoxime on discharge to be given only on hemodialysis days, after dialysis as this antibiotic is renally cleared.

2)Altered mental status: Likely delirium in the setting of infection, sedating meds, ICU stay especially in setting of advanced age.  In addition, daughter reports that she took trazodone two days prior to admission, which has caused confusion in the past.  She had a CT head on admission without acute process.  Her mental status cleared during her hospital stay and treatment of pneumonia.

3)Coagulopathy: Her INR was 2 on admission, however climbed to peak of 5.3 likley due to poor nutrition and antibiotics.  Her coumadin was stopped [**12-25**] and held throughout the remainder of her admission.  She was restarted on 1mg coumdain on discharge with INR checks with dialysis. Her INR was 2.9 on the day of discharge.

4)Chronic renal failure: Secondary to ANCA vasculitis. Decision made to initiate HD last admission.  She was dialysed for volume overload in the hospital and was dishcarged with plan for dialysis at FMC - West Suburban Dialysis Center.  She was continued on epogen with dialysis, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium.

5)Anemia: Baseline mid-20s as of most recent [**12-10**] admission; prior to that was in the low 30s. No signs or symptoms of active bleeding, guaiac negative.   She was transfused one unit PRBC with dialysis on [**12-26**] with stable hematocrit around 26 throughout the remainder of her hospitalization.  She should be continued on epogen with dialysis.

6)Diarrhea - patient has developed diarrhea in setting of multiple admissions and antibiotics.  She had one stool that was negative for C. diff and was started on loperamide to decrease stool output given skin breakdown.  She was also advised to eat yogurt three times daily.  Diarrhea is most likely antibiotic associated due to alteration of normal bowel flora, however she will require two additional stool samples to rule out C.diff. She will require monitoring of in's and out's and encouragement for oral intake to prevent dehydration.

7)Skin Breakdown: During her admission she began developing skin breakdown on her gluteal cleft likely due to a combination of immobility due to acute illness and diarrhea as discussed above.  She will require close monitoring of her skin and frequent personal care to keep her buttocks clean and protected.

8)Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation:  Her metoprolol was initially held in the ICU given sinus bradycardia and sepsis.  It was resumed at home dose on [**12-26**] however given borderline blood pressures, it was decreased to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**12-27**].

9) Spiculated lesion on CT chest: as discussed in radiology report, will need repeat CT in 3 months to reassess this lesion for stability.

10)Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine

 Discharge Disposition: Extended Care

Facility: st. [**Doctor Last Name 2375**] manor

Discharge Diagnosis: Chronic Kidney disease on hemodialysis Wegener's granulomatosis Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation COPD Non-infectious diarrhea

Secondary Diagnoses: Anemia

 Discharge Condition: fair O2 saturation 95% on 0.5L NC

 Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with confusion, low blood pressure and low oxygen most likely due to a serious pneumonia. You were intubated and sent to the ICU for care.  You improved and were able to be extubated the following day.  You were treated with antibiotics for pneumonia and your breathing improved.  You had blood cultures, urine cultures and stool cultures which did not show any evidence of infection.

You had dialysis with fluid removal as you were given a large amount of IV fluids on admission for your infection which caused swelling in your arms and fluid around your lungs.

You developed diarrhea during your admission which is most likely due to antibiotics.  You were started on loperamide to attempt to decrease the diarrhea and to prevent further skin breakdown.

Medications: 1)You will be discharged on cefpodoxime to complete a 2 week course of antibiotics.  This should be taken only on dialysis days, after your dialysis. 2)You can take loperamide as needed to decrease your diarrhea. 3)Your coumadin was held during your admission but can be restarted on discharge as your INR was down to 2.9. 4)Your metoprolol was decreased to 75mg twice daily as your blood pressure was borderline low. No other changes were made to your medications.

Please follow up as below.

Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you have any concerning symptoms including fevers, confusion, chest pain, trouble breathing, low blood pressure or other worrisome symptoms.
