 CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chronic right ankle infection with unstable joint.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old male with a nonhealing right malleolar wound and fracture for the last 2 years who underwent a right ankle traction and open reduction internal fixation. The patient has had multiple admissions for wound infections and multiple IV antibiotic courses. Most recent admission was [**2189-9-28**], for a wound infection. The patient recently complained of a temperature elevation on [**2189-11-30**], and now is to be admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1392**] service for continued IV antibiotics. The patient initially was discharged on daptomycin and followed by VNA.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Type 2 diabetes with triopathy, endstage renal disease secondary to diabetes, status post cadaver transplant in [**2182**], history of coronary artery disease, status post CABG in [**2178**], history of peripheral vascular disease, right ankle fracture in [**2188-6-6**], with an open reduction internal fixation, status post hardware removal, chronic osteomyelitis.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Percocet, dicloxacillin 100 mg twice a day, gabapentin 1600 mg twice a day, Lasix 20 mg twice a day, Sensipar 30 mg daily, metoprolol 25 mg daily, ranitidine 150 mg daily. There are two other medications that the patient is on, of which the handwriting is not decipherable at this time.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a nonsmoker, is married and lives with his spouse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 94.6, 94, 18, blood pressure 144/88, oxygen saturation 93% in room air. Blood sugar fingerstick was 291 on admission. General appearance: Alert, cooperative white male in no acute distress. HEENT exam: Mild right eye ptosis. Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy or carotid bruits. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Chest is with a well healed median sternotomy incision. Heart is a regular rate and rhythm with a systolic ejection murmur II/VI, nonradiating. Abdomen is soft, nontender, obese. Extremities: Right malleolus with punctate lesion with draining and surrounding erythema. Pulse exam shows palpable radial pulses, femoral pulses bilaterally. The right DP and PT are dopplerable signals. The left DP and PT are dopplerable signs. Neurological exam is nonfocal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the vascular service. His dicloxacillin was continued. Vancomycin and Flagyl were instituted. He was continued on his preadmission medications. He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] and advisement was made for him to undergo a below the knee amputation. The patient accepted the recommendation. Transplant nephrology was consulted to follow the patient during his hospitalization. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for hyperglycemic management. Daily SK5 levels were obtained. He required minimal adjustment in his immunosuppression. He continued on his Lantus with a Humalog sliding scale with improvement in his glycemic control. On [**2189-12-3**], he underwent a right BKA without incident. He was transferred to the PACU in stable condition. At the end of his surgical procedure intraoperatively, the patient became hypotensive with systolic blood pressure in the 60s and he was given Neo 200 mcg x2 and epinephrine 5 mg x2. The patient went into a monomorphic VT 4 minutes at a rate of 130. He was given lidocaine 100 mg IV bolus and amiodarone 125 mg over 15 minutes. The patient converted to sinus rhythm. An intraoperative TEE showed severe biventricular failure. Dopamine was started at 5 mcg/kg/minute. Blood pressure improved. He was transferred to the PACU and then to the ICU for continued care. Serial enzymes were obtained. Repeat echo was obtained on the 28th which demonstrated left ventricular wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained by 2-D images. He has severely depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. He had multiple regional wall motion abnormalities. His aortic valve was moderately thickened leaflets. There were no masses or vegetations on the aortic valve. No aortic insufficiency. The mitral valve, tricuspid valve were normal with trivial MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. The pulmonic valve and artery were unremarkable. The pericardium showed no pleural effusion. Aortic valve area was calculated at 1.3 cm squared, normal is 3 cm squared. Gradient peak was 32 mm. There was no intracardiac thrombus noted on the primary or the secondary echo. The ejection fraction was calculated at 30% to 40%. IV heparin was begun to maintain a goal PTT between 40 and 60. The patient's Dobutamine was weaned with hopes to extubate. Pulse exam remained unchanged. The right amputation site was clean dry dressing. He remained on bedrest in the SICU. Cardiac enzymes: Base was 20, peaked at 96 for the CK. CK MBs were not obtained. His troponins were 0.01 and 0.03. The patient's Swan was converted to a CVL on [**2189-12-4**]. The patient continued on heparin, was extubated and transferred to the VICU for continued monitoring and care on [**2189-12-5**]. Cardiology was requested to see the patient on [**2189-12-6**], who felt the patient was hemodynamically stable and his atrial fibrillation was rate controlled. We should continue the heparin while his INR is less than 2 and his goal INR should be [**1-9**], and recommend metoprolol tartrate twice a day versus single dosing. They recommended aspirin 81 mg and simvastatin 20 mg daily. Hyperglycemia control remained relatively good. He did not require adjustment in his Lantus. His premeal coverage was adjusted. Vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and Flagyl were discontinued on [**2189-12-7**]. The patient remained afebrile. Foley was discontinued. Peripheral line was placed and the central line was discontinued. The patient had been advanced to a regular diet and ambulation to chair was begun. On [**2189-12-8**], postoperative day 5, the patient continues on IV heparin/Coumadinization conversion. Serial coags were monitored. Physical therapy will see the patient and make recommendations regarding disposition planning, being a new amputation if he will go to rehabilitation. Will talk to infectious disease, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2379**], regarding discontinue the doxycycline. The remaining hospital course, the patient will be discharged when medically stable and bed available at rehabilitation. At the time of discharge, discharge medication instructions will be dictated.
