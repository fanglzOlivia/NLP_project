 History of Present Illness: 66 year old male who presented with worsening shortness of breath and hypotension. He presented to his PCP's office for follow up and was noted to be short of breath and hypotensive with SBP's in the 80's. His symptoms started approximately 2-3 weeks prior to presentation. He mainly had difficulty with shortness of breath. This shortness of breath would prevent him from sleeping comfortably. He describes symptoms consistent with orthopnea and PND. He notes that he saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] a couple of weeks ago and was started on lasix and aldactone. He was also noted to be in atrial fibrillation at that time as well. He is now being referred to cardiac surgery for evaluation of revascularization and possible aortic valve replacement.

CXR [**2198-7-17**]: Semi-upright portable AP view of the chest obtained. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly with diffuse ground-glass haziness throughout the lungs compatible with pulmonary edema. The right hemidiaphragm remains somewhat elevated and overall low lung volumes are noted which somewhat limit the evaluation. There are no large pleural effusions and no sign of pneumothorax. Hilar engorgement is compatible with congestive heart failure.  Bony structures appear intact. IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema.

LHC [**2198-7-23**]: 1) Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system demonstrated severe three vessel CAD. The LMCA was normal without any angiographically-apparent flow-limiting lesions. The stent in the proximal LAD had diffuse 60% in-stent restenosis. There was 80% stenosis throuhgout the proximal LCX, with a 60-70% stenosis at the origin of the OMB. The RCA had a 100% proximal stenosis with prominent left-to-right collaterals. 2) Resting hemodynamics showed elevated right and left-sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 17 mmHg and an LVEDP of 27 mmHg. The peak gradient over the aortic valve was 14 mmHg. Using the Gorlin equation, the [**Location (un) 109**] was calculated to be 1.1 cm2, indicating moderate aortic

stenosis. 3) Left ventriculography was deferred.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Moderate aortic stenosis. 3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 4. Needs diuresis prior to cardioversion. 5. Consideration for AVR-CABG.

LENI [**2198-7-24**]: negative for DVT

 Brief Hospital Course: The patient underwent the usual preoperative work-up.  Dental examined the patient and recommended extraction of one tooth. The patient refused. The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2198-7-25**] where the patient underwent AVR (tissue), CABG x 3, resection of left atrial appendage with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. He does have a history of heart failure with an EF of 30% and initially required multiple inotropes and vasopressors.  He remained intubated due to pulmonary congestion, which improved with diuresis.  Rapid a-fib developed and amiodarone drip was initiated.  This was discontinued when rate was controlled.  He failed a trial of Precedex.  He self-extubated and was re-intubated without incident.  He developed a leukocytosis and was started on cipro for a positive urinalysis.  There was no growth on culture, and cipro was discontinued.  Tube feeds were started on POD 3.  He was extubated on POD 4.  By this time, all vasoactive drips had been weaned.  Coumadin was resumed for chronic a-fib.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  Beta-blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the pre-operative weight. ACE Inhibitor was not initiated due to a rise in Creatinine, which would start to trend down prior to discharge.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD #10 the patient was ambulating freely, and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. Due to upper and lower pole serosanguinous sternal drainage, Mr.[**Known lastname 1884**] was placed on prophylactic antibiotics x 1 week per Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient was discharged  to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
