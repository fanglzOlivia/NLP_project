Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1857**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central venous line insertion (right internal jugular vein)

History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] is an 84 yo man with moderate aortic stenosis (outside hospital echo in [**2124**] with [**Location (un) 109**] 1 cm2, gradient 28 mmHg, moderate mitral regurgitation, mild aortic insufficiency), chronic left ventricular systolic heart failure with EF 25-30%, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, CAD s/p CABG in [**2099**] with SVG-LAD-Diagonal, SVG-OM, and SVG-RPDA-RPL, with a re-do CABG in [**9-/2117**] with LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-diagonal, and SVG-RCA. He also has severe peripheral arterial disease s/p peripheral bypass surgery. He presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital ER this morning with shortness of breath and chest pain and was found to be in heart failure.

He states he was in his usual state of health until 10:30 last evening when he woke up feeling cold; 1 hour later he developed moderate to severe sharp chest pain radiating across his chest associated with nausea, diaphoresis, and dypsnea. The pain was fairly constant and did not resolve until he was given sL NTG at 6 am by EMS. He has been pain free since. Presenting vitals BP 109/66, HR 71, O2 sat 88% on RA. CXR showed congestive heart failure; initial troponin-I was mildly elevated at 0.4, CK 70. He given aspirin and furosemide 80 mg IV (with ~600cc diuresis), Nitropaste [**1-3**]", and Lovenox 80 mg SQ. During the ambulance transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**], he also received ~500 cc IVF for ? low BP).

On further questioning, Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] has very poor exercise tolerance due to knee pain that he attributes to osteoarthritis. But he says that he gets chest pain (similar to pain he had last night) with fairly minimal exertion (picking up his 11 lb cat, carrying 1 gallon jug of water, first getting up from sitting to walk outside or to walk to the bedroom). The pain is associated with dyspnea and is relieved with few minutes rest. His symptoms occur about every day to every other day and have been stable over the past year. He denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, but does endorse exertional dyspnea (he cannot identify the amount of exertion required). Currently, he is dyspneic and feels somewhat better sitting up; he reports no chest pain.

ROS is also positive for a nose bleed requiring ED visit several months ago (and cessation of Plavix for a few days), and currently gross hematuria after Foley placement and Lovenox.

Past Medical History: 1. Coronary artery disease s/p CABG twice (vide infra). 2. Hypertension. 3. Diabetes mellitus. 4. Hyperlipidemia. 5. Peripheral arterial disease with occluded left common iliac artery, S/P right iliac artery stenting and femoral-to-femoral bypass, further angioplasty to the right profunda. 5. Ischemic cardiomyopathy and chronic LV systolic heart failure, reported LVEF 25-30%. 6. Moderate-severe aortic stenosis. 7. Osteoarthritis.

CAD: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension

Cardiac History: CABG in [**2099**] (SVG-LAD-Diagonal, SVG-OM, and SVG-RPDA-RPL), with a re-do CABG in [**9-/2117**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-diagonal, and SVG-RCA)

Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2120**] anatomy as follows: Patent SVG to OM1, patent SVG to PDA which filled the distal PDA as well as the R-PL via a jump segment. Stump occlusion of a graft presumably to the right system as well as one stump that could be documented of a graft to the left. Other SVG's were not able to be selectively engaged. Supravalvular aortography demonstrated no other patent grafts. Patent LIMA to mid-LAD, which also back-perfused the diagonal via a patent jump graft that was interposed between the LAD and the diagonal.

Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use. There is no history of alcohol abuse.

ECG [**2125-2-9**]  9:36:38 PM Rhythm is most likely sinus rhythm with frequent ventricular premature beats with occasional ventricular bigeminal pattern. There are also frequent atrial premature beats. Intraventricular conduction defect. Left ventricular hypertrophy. ST-T wave changes most likely related to left ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2124-4-9**] ventricular premature beats are more frequent, as are atrial premature beats. Clinical correlation is suggested.

CXR [**2125-2-9**]: The patient is after median sternotomy and CABG. The heart size appears slightly enlarged compared to the previous study.  Bilateral perihilar haziness continues toward the lower lungs is new consistent with new moderate- to-severe pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusion is present, also new, most likely part of the heart failure.   Left and right retrocardiac opacities consistent with atelectasis.

ECHO [**2125-2-11**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolaterl walls. There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 25-30 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.6 cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior report (images unavailable of [**2119-5-8**], left ventricular systolic function is now depressed and the severity of aortic stenosis has increased.

Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 84 yo man with CAD s/p CABG twice with daily angina, presenting with chest pain, dyspnea, and congestive heart failure.

# CAD: The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup and treatment of chest pain. A chest X-ray performed on admission showed moderate-severe pulmonary edema. He did have a stably elevated troponin thought to be related to acute heart failure or demand ischemia. He was started on a Lasix drop at 10 mg/hr for initiation of diuresis. He initially tolerated this well, however at approximately 8 pm on [**2125-2-10**], Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] was transferred from the floor to the CCU after complaining of chest pain when he was sitting in bed after dinner. As he was being evaluated by the housestaff, he became unresponsive and developed pulseless electrical arrest. Chest compressions were started, but within approximately 2 minutes, he became responsive and regained a palpable pulse. His rhythm appeared to be atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate initially in the 50s but rising to the 110's. Review of his telemetry showed that he had developed atrial fibillation earlier in the evening without obvious ventricular arrhythmias immediately prior to his arrest (which was attributed to a vasovagal episode in the setting of heart failure and aortic stenosis).  On transfer to the CCU, he was started on levophed for hypotension and amiodarone IV for AFib. Chest x-ray on [**2125-2-10**] showed interval worsening of pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.  At this time his cardiac enzymes became very elevated with EKG changes consistent of a NSTEMI with a CK to 1006 and troponin to 3.82. On [**2125-2-11**], he had a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls. LVEF was 25-30 %, with severe aortic stenosis and [**1-3**]+ mitral regurgitation. He was aggressively diuresed with an IV Lasix drip with improvement in his oxygen requirement and chest x-ray.  Levophed was discontinued on [**2-12**], and blood pressures remained stable off pressors with MAP's 60 - 70.  On [**2125-2-13**], he was transferred back to the floor team on PO amiodarone. He remained in normal sinus rhythm on telemetry on po amiodarone, and diuresis was continued with a Lasix drip with good urine output and improvement of renal function. He remained asymptomatic with no shortness of breath or chest pain after transfer. He was maintained on a heparin drip bridging to Coumadin for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. His metoprolol was held for hypotension in the ICU and relative hypotension with SBP in 90s and low 100s upon transfer to the floor. ACE-inhibitor was held due to relative hypotension and renal insufficiency with Creat 1.7. A cardiac surgery consult deemed him an acceptable candidate for a 3rd open heart surgery for aortic valve replacement pending re-assessment of his coronary anatomy. The intermediate-term plan was to allow recovery from the current episode and discussion as an outpatient with his primary cardiologist regarding the risks and benefits of aortic valve replacement.

On [**2-16**], the patient became hypotensive to SBPs to 60s-70s after getting into a chair after breakfast. He was given 1L NS with no response in BP. The patient was mentating but became short of breath with IVF. He had worsening EKG changes. He was started on Levophed without improvement in his blood pressure. He was brought to the catherization laboratory for potential emergent aortic valvuloplasty and was intubated. At that point, he suffered a PEA arrest and could not be resuscitated. He was pronounced deceased at 12:33pm.

# Pump: As above. The patient had severe pulmonary edema with initial exam revealing crackles throughout his lung fields. He was treated with a Lasix drip which was transitioned on [**2-16**] to po Lasix 80 mg po twice daily.

# Rhythm: Patient was in NSR on admission. On HD #2, he had chest pain, then went into PEA arrest as described above. Telemetry showed atrial fibrillation prior to the event. In the CCU, he was started on amiodarone 400 mg po tid to be tapered over the subsequent weeks.

# Acute renal failure: Renal function initially declined (creatinine to 2.1), then improved on Lasix gtt, but stayed 1.7 - 1.9 (above baseline of 1.3).

# Hematuria: He had hematuria (no clots) after traumatic Foley placement at the outside hospital. The catheter was removed on [**2-16**] with gradual resolution of hematuria.

# Diabetes: Due to acute renal failre, metformin was discontinued and the patient was maintained on a Humalog sliding scale with 30 units of Lantus at bedtime.

# Hematoma. The patient developed a small hematoma at the site of his right internal jugular venous access after catheter removal. This was treated with local compression.
