CHEST (PA & LAT) - [**2179-5-30**] As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of mild bilateral hilar enlargement, potentially due to hilar lymphadenopathy or enlarged pulmonary arteries.  Minimal atelectasis at the left lung base and along the minor fissure. No evidence of pneumonia, no pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.

 Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 939**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service on [**2179-5-24**] and taken to the Operating Room for L2-S1 interbody fusion through an anterior approach.

# Lumbar spondylosis, scoliosis, and stenosis. Please refer to the dictated operative note for further details. The surgery was without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a stable condition. TEDs/pneumoboots were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis. Intravenous antibiotics were given per standard protocol. Initial postop pain was controlled with a PCA. On HD#2 she returned to the operating room for a scheduled L2-S1 decompression with PSIF as part of a staged 2-part procedure. Please refer to the dictated operative note for further details. The second surgery was also without complication and the patient was transferred to the T/SICU in a stable condition. Postoperative HCT was 25 and she was given 2 units PRBCs.  She was maintained on strict supine bedrest for 48 hours given the small dural tear that was noted. She was kept NPO until bowel function returned then diet was advanced as tolerated. The patient was transitioned to oral pain medication when tolerating PO diet. Foley was removed on POD#3 from the second procedure. She was fitted with a lumbar warm-n-form brace for comfort. Physical therapy was consulted for mobilization OOB to ambulate.

#) Delirium: During her post-operative course, the patient was noted to be confused and disoriented, prompting transfer to medicine for further management of her delirium.  This was felt to be possibly as secondary to narcotic medication and lingering effects of anesthesia.  Infectious etiologies were ruled out and the patient underwent an ABG which did not reveal evidence of hypoventilation.  Her mental status improved significantly and she was awake, alert, oriented x3 and long longer confused prior to discharge.

#) Pain control: The patient was intially maintained on a fentanyl PCA and this was transitioned to oral pain medications with good control prior to discharge.  She was followed by the chronic pain service given her history of multiple medication allergies.  She is to be discharged on tramadol, topiramate, and aceaminophen.

#) Anemia Patient's baselined hematocrit was felt to be approximately 40 (from [**2179-4-24**]).  She required PRBC transfusions given intraoperative blood [**Last Name (un) 940**].  Her hematocrit remained stable upon discharge (28-29).
