Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**] Chief Complaint: fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.  Exploratory laparotomy. 2.  Pancreatic debridement with wide drainage. 3.  Open cholecystectomy. 4.  Placement of a combined G/J tube (MIC tube). 5.  PICC line placement 6.  ERCP with stent

 History of Present Illness: This is a 75 year old man who is a retired anethesiologist with h/o CAD s/p CABG and ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF of 25% who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] following a hospital course for gallstone pancreatitis and now re-presents from rehab for fevers.  During last admission, he was transferred from OSH with with fever and pancreatitis which was thought to be from gallstones although there were no gallstones in the bile ducts, just in the gallbladder itself.  CT scan done on admissionw as consistent with severe pancreatitis.  ERCP was done on [**2198-4-6**], with sphinceterotomy and CBD stent placed.  His post procedure course was complicated by fevers and repeat CT abd shows progression of severe pancreatitis with extensive peripancreatitis fluid collection.  This was thought to be either from PNA or from inflammation from his pancreatitis.  He finished a course of azithro/ctx and a course of flagyl/cipro and eventually he devefesced.  All cultures were negative.  He was discharged to rehab. . At rehab, he reports having fevers since Friday [**2198-4-21**], with highest at 102.0.  He has no localizing pain.  Denies cough, dysuria, abd pain or nausea and vomit. . ROS: Negative for headache, chest pain, shortness of breath or change in bowel habits.

CT ABD WITH IV AND ORAL CONTRAST: 1. All visualized peripancreatic collections appear slightly smaller. 2. New air bubbles within multiple collections. Correlate with history of marsupialization or attempts at drainage in the interval since [**2198-4-10**]. Superimposed infection in the collections cannot be excluded given the new air bubbles, although the collections are infected, they would not expect to get smaller. 3. Biliary stent in position. No evidence of worsening biliary dilatation. 4. Cholelithiasis and Phrygian cap in gallbladder. 5. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with associated bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. Effusions slightly larger than on [**2198-2-8**].

CXR: Small bilateral pleural effusions have increased. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable. Upper lungs grossly clear. Atelectasis at the lung bases is slightly more severe today. No pneumothorax. Transvenous right atrial pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are unchanged in their respective positions. The patient is status post median sternotomy and coronary bypass grafting. .

REPEAT, (REQUEST BY RADIOLOGIST)  [**2198-5-5**] 6:47 PM FINDINGS: X-ray of the three surgical drains revealed no evidence of any contrast which is radiopaque within these drains. . CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2198-5-5**] 12:07 PM IMPRESSION: 1. Heterogeneity in the region of the pancreas consistent with the patient's previous necrotizing pancreatitis. 2. Three surgical drains in situ with some high attenuation in the region of the lesser sac which may represent fistulization from the small bowel into this residual collection. 3. Loculated fluid under the anterior abdominal wall measuring 16 cm. 4. Gastrojejunostomy in situ. 5. Renal cysts. 6. Bilateral pleural effusions. 7. Enlarged prostate at 8 cm. .

 Brief Hospital Course: 75 year old man with CAD s/p CABD and ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 25% who was recently admitted for gallstone pancreatitis, now re-admitted from rehab for fevers. . # FEVERS: Likely source is from his pancreas.  On last admission, he was febrile without an identified infectious source and was thought to be from inflammatory response to pancreatitis and peri-pancreatic fluid.  Currently with leukocytosis and left shift although no localizing signs of infection.  The differential at this time includes (infected) pancreatic pseudocyst, necrotizing pancreatitis and an obstructed bile duct stent. -- appreciate GI following -- keep NPO for now until CT scan and labs return -- CT scan of abdomen with oral and IV contrast -- culture blood and urine -- CXR to r/o PNA . # CAD: currenty stable without chest pain. -- continue asa + captopril + carvedilol . # CHF: currently euvolemic, and stable. -- admitted and dry weight: -- continue asa + captopril + carvedilol . # Aflutter: currently apaced -- continue to hold coumadin in case he needs surgery -- continue carvedilol . # CRI: Baseline creatinine 1.2-1.5 -- hydration and bicarb prior to contrast study -- continue to monitor creatinine . # ANEMIA: iron studies from last admission suggest iron deficiency and chronic disease -- continue iron supplements -- continue to monitor hct . # GOUT: continue allopurinol . # BPH: continue flomax [**Hospital1 **] . # FEN: -- IV hydration prior to CT scan . # PPX: -- ambulating -- protonix . # CODE: full . # DISPO: pending . . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ================================================================ Surgery was then consulted and he went to the OR on [**4-24**] for his Infected pancreatic necrosis, status post gallstone pancreatitis. He had 1.  Exploratory laparotomy. 2.  Pancreatic debridement with wide drainage. 3.  Open cholecystectomy. 4.  Placement of a combined G/J tube (MIC tube).

Post-op he stayed in the ICU for 2 nights and was trasnfered to the floor on POD 3.

GI/Abd: He was NPO with a NGT and IVF. The NGT was removed on POD 2. His G-tube was left to gravity drainage. His J-tube was capped and then trophic tubefeedings were started on POD 2. His tubefeedings were advanced to a goal of Replete with Fiber 3/4 strength at 80cc/hr. He had 3 JP drains in place and these were draining thick, dark fluid. He continued to have high output from these drains. He was started on sips on POD 5, he was advanced to clears on POD 6. JP amylase was checked on POD 7, once on a full liquid diet. His JP Amylase was 27K, 34K, and 14K. He was made NPO due to his JP amylase reported as high. He continued on the tubefeedings. A grape juice test was positive for a leak from around the JP drains. He had one small spot with minimal drainage that could be expressed from his incision. His is now having drainage around all his drains and g/j tube with mild skin irritation. He has irritation around the tube extending out from ~0.5 - 3 cm and appears at [**Doctor First Name **] to develop yeast. His midline incision is c/i but has a small amount of serous drainage on the gauze.

Have suggested using Criticaid anti fungal moisture barrier to protect his skin from the drainage and to prevent the formation of yeast. Continue to apply a thin layer of dressing around the drains and change as needed do not allow the gauze to become saturated with drainage. Apply the antifungal Criticaid two to three times/day.

 A CT was obtained on [**5-5**] and showed: 1. Heterogeneity in the region of the pancreas consistent with the patient's previous necrotizing pancreatitis. 2. Three surgical drains in situ with some high attenuation in the region of the lesser sac which may represent fistulization from the small bowel into this residual collection. 3. Loculated fluid under the anterior abdominal wall measuring 16 cm. 4. Gastrojejunostomy in situ. 5. Renal cysts. 6. Bilateral pleural effusions. 7. Enlarged prostate at 8 cm. . He will remain NPO with TF for 2 weeks and then return for a repeat CT. His drains will remain and the drainage will be monitored.

Pain: He had good pain control with a PCA. He continued on a PCA thru POD 6. Once back on a diet, he was ordered for PO pain meds with good control.

Labs: We monitored his labs and his Tbili decreased from a high of 2.6 on POD 2 to WNL by [**2198-4-28**].

Cards: He was being followed by his PCP/Cardiologist. He was put back on his home meds on POD5, including Lasix IV for gentle diuresis and his heart meds.

Renal: He was diuresing well and continued to have negative fluid balance and losing weight appropriately.
