Pericardial fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. . ECHO ([**2203-11-3**]) Pre-pericardiocentesis: The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial pressure is >20 mmHg. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is a large circumferential pericardial effusion. Stranding is visualized within the pericardial space c/w some organization. There is left atrial diastolic collapse. There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology. There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-10-20**], large pericardial effusion with echocardiographic signs of tamponade is new. . ECHO ([**2203-11-3**]) Post pericardiocentesis: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is partial flail of a tricuspid valve leaflet. The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-11-3**], the residue pericardial effusion is minimal. . Cardiac catherization ([**2203-11-3**]): 1. Large circumferential pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology. 2. Successful pericardiocentesis with drainage of 1500mls of blood stained fluid. Patient left cathlab in stable condition FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Severe pericardial tamponade. 2. Mild primary pulmonary hypertension. 3. Successful pericardiocentesis with drainage of 1500ml of blood stained fluid. . ECHO ([**2203-11-4**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal [intrinsic function is likely depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]. There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened and appear shortened/remnants that do not fully coapt. A small echodensity is seen on the right atrial side of the septal leaflet - ?vegetation ?old vs. partial flail of leaflet segment. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is a small (<1cm), circumferential, partially echo filled pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise.

Compared with the prior study (post-pericardiocentesis, images reviewed) of [**2203-11-3**], the findings are similar. . ECHO ([**2203-11-5**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened and appear shortened/remnants and fail to fully coapt. A small echodensity is again seen on the right atrial side of the septal leaflet which could be either a vegeateion or a partial leaflet segment. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-11-4**], the pericardial effusion is slightly smaller and may be more echo dense. The left ventricular cavity size is probably slightly larger (reflecting better filling). The small echodensity on the tricuspid leaflet has not changed in size. . ECHO ([**2203-11-8**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-11-5**], pericardial effusion now appears slightly smaller. . ECHO ([**2203-11-11**]): The right atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. There is a very small, partially echo filled pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-11-8**], the findings are similar.

 Brief Hospital Course: 41 year old male with HIV/AIDS, previous R-sided endocarditis and severe TR, presented in cardiac tamponade from rehabilitation.

CARDIAC TAMPONADE:  On admission, he was transferred to the cardiac catherization lab, where over one liter of fluid was drained from his pericardial space.  The fluid was sent for gram stain, culture, AFB, [**Doctor First Name **], TB PCR as well as viral studies and cytology.  A pericardial drain was initially left in place, but given minimal drainage over 24 hours, was pulled prior to his transfer to the floor.  The etiology of the pericardial effusion is unknown.  He was followed by Cardiology on the floor and the initial plan was for a pericardial window, for both tissue and to prevent reaccumulation of fluid.  The patient refused the procedure at this time.  He will follow up as an outpatient to re-evaluate for the procedure.  The effusion was followed by serial ECHO while the patient was in the hospital.  There was no evidence of re-accumulation.  He is scheduled for an outpatient ECHO in several weeks to evaluate the pericardial space for reaccumlation of effusion.

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION/FLUTTER: Per multiple EKGs, the patient appears to have developed new a fib/flutter.  Given his guaiac positive stools, it is not advisable to start anticoagulation at this time.  The patient is being rate controlled on a low dose of beta-blocker, which appears to be effective.  He will be followed by outpatient Cardiology.

ANEMIA: The patient had a hematocrit drop during this admission.  His lab studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease, however, the patient was found to have guaiac positive stools. GI was consulted and recommeded colonoscopy and EGD.  The patient was unable to tolerate the prep and thus the colonoscopy was cancelled.  His EGD demonstrated gastritis and thrush.  He was started on fluconazole to treat the thrush.  He was also transfused two units of packed red blood cells with an appropriate hematocrit response.

HIV/AIDS:  The patient had a CD4 count checked during his last admission, it was found to be 132 with a viral load >100K. Given his past noncompliance with HAART therapy and the risk of developing drug resistant HIV,  HAART was not restarted.  Pt is willing to restart HARRT, and the plan remains to restart medications at rehabilitation.  Bactrim was continued for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].

OSTEOMYELITIS:  The patient was previously admitted for left ankle pain.  He was followed previously by both the orthopedic and ID services.  Both services continued to follow the patient on this admission.  The patient was continued on 6 weeks of IV antibiotics (last day of cefazolin [**2203-12-5**]), although the dose was decreased to 1g q6 because of a low white blood count.

SEVERE TRICUSPID REGURGITATION: Pt with known grade 4 TR and flail leaflet which he deveoped after acute bacterial endocarditis roughly 10 years ago.  We restarted his lasix and spironolactone on this admission.

HCV: HCV viral load checked, and found to be 1.5 million.  No further therapy initiated.

ANXIETY: Pt with history of anxiety and on Klonapin at home. His home regimen was continued.

ESOPHAGEAL CANDIDIASIS: Patient was found to have thrush on EGD.  He was started on a course of fluconazole given his immunosupressed state.  He is being discharged to complete a two week course of anti-fungal medication.
