HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma with known metastases to the liver and lung who status post resection in the 90s with recurrence in [**2146**] status post treatment with Taxol.

She presented to the Emergency Room on [**2152-10-3**], with altered mental status, decreased p.o. intake, confusion and headache over several weeks, and was found to have three mass lesions in her brain on head CT.

The patient was started on Decadron, as well as Dilantin.  In the Emergency Room she became hypertensive and was sent to the SICU.  She was maintained on Nipride GTT.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was weaned off Nipride and then changed to Labetalol, Hydralazine. The patient was also noted to have cellulitis on her left knee and was initially maintained on Vancomycin and later changed to Keflex.

The patient was also evaluated by Radiation/Oncology, and it was decided that the patient would received a total of seven treatments of whole brain radiation therapy in conjunction with Decadron, as well as Dilantin.

During her Intensive Care Unit stay, the patient had increased alertness and was more oriented, although she does have a history of baseline dementia.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a home health aide.  Husband died three months ago.  She walks but recently was unable to do so.  She otherwise has a very close family.

FAMILY HISTORY:  On maternal side there is a history of diabetes, as well as hypertension.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 96.5??????, blood pressure 161/47, pulse 74, respirations 14, oxygen saturation 98% on 2 L, 92% on room air.  General:  She was elderly, lying in bed.  She was sometimes agitated and not following commands.  She was nonverbal.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements intact.  Dry mucous membranes.  There was poor dentition.  Neck:  Supple.  No lymphadenopathy. Heart:  Regular, rate and rhythm.  There was an early systolic ejection murmur, 3 out of 6.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Good bowel sounds.  Extremities:  There were bilateral skin eschars.  The left knee had excoriation and was erythematous.  Neurological:  The patient was obtunded and not following commands.  She had a limited neurologic exam.  Cranial nerves II, III and IV intact.  She was moving both hands with appropriate strength.  No lifting of left arm off bed.  Right lower extremity with decreased strength, apparently chronic secondary to polio.  On the left lower extremity, she moved toes and feet.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission her white count was 6.4, hematocrit 37.5, platelet count 269, neutrophils 73, 22 lymphs, 3 monos; INR 1.1, PT 12.7, PTT 27.8; sodium 138, potassium 4.3, chloride 106, bicarb 22, BUN 36, creatinine 1.8, baseline 1.4-1.5; platelet count 151; calcium 10.6, magnesium 1.9, phos 3.1, CK 116, MB 5, troponin 0.04; Albumin 4.2; TSH 2.9; urinalysis with occasional bacteria, trace ketones, 30 protein.

Electrocardiogram was paced, lateral T-wave inversion, inferior T-wave inversion which new consistent with [**2152-6-23**].

Head CT showed three moderately large-sized mass lesions in the right posterior frontal, right anterior frontal lobe and left parietal lesion with significant edema.  There was a small amount of peripheral density, question of hemorrhage or calcification.

Chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly, atelectasis, but no overt failure.

Knee films showed no fracture and no dislocation and degenerative changes with small right knee effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Altered mental status:  This was felt to be secondary to metastatic disease to the brain.  The patient was evaluated by Radiation/Oncology, and it was decided that the patient would receive a total of seven treatments of whole-brain radiation therapy.

Additionally she was maintained on Decadron, as well as Dilantin.  The patient had no seizure activity while in the hospital.  She tolerated her Decadron well and tolerated her whole-brain radiation therapy without any complications.

The patient was discharged on a Decadron taper.  Her Dilantin dose was increased to a total of 300 three times a day, given that her Dilantin level [**Company 2240**].i.d. was only 8.  The patient will need her Dilantin level followed as an outpatient at her next appointment.

2.  Hypertension:  The patient's blood pressures while in the Emergency Room were noted to be 200/100; however, once she was transferred to the floor, she maintained very good control on a combination of Clonidine, Hydrochlorothiazide and Minoxidil, Hydralazine, as well as Labetalol 400 b.i.d. The patient's blood pressures were maintained in the 140s to 160s systolic, and it was decided that this was an appropriate range given that the patient needed to have adequate perfusion in the face of increased intracranial pressure.

3.  Cellulitis:  The patient was initially maintained on Vancomycin, and this was later changed to Keflex.  The patient did not develop any rash or other complications Keflex.  Her cellulitis was improved by the time of discharge.

4.  Renal insufficiency:  Her creatinine remained at baseline between 1.4-1.5.

5.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient was maintained on enteric coated Aspirin, as well as Labetalol.  The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction, and her electrocardiogram remained stable without any EKG changes.

6.  FEN:  The patient was maintained on a soft diet, as well as thin liquids.  She tolerated this without event. Additionally her electrolytes were followed daily and were repleted as needed.  Her I&Os were monitored closely.

7.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:  The patient is paced. She was rate controlled.  She was held off all anticoagulation given her metastatic disease to the brain.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to her home because her family wanted the patient to do so.  The patient has [**12-27**] full-time nurses that will be following her once she is discharged to home.  Her mental status improved greatly while the patient was in the hospital.  By the time of discharge, the patient was conversive and much more alert and oriented.

Her neurologic exam was significant for intact cranial nerves and the ability to move all extremities spontaneously.  She did have limited movement in her arms, given that she has a history of bursitis.  Otherwise, the patient's exam neurologically was much improved.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.  She was stable on room air. She could not ambulate without assistance and does need help with all bed transfers.  She was tolerating a p.o. diet without problems.  [**Name (NI) **] mental status had improved considerably in that she was conversant, could move her extremities spontaneously, and cranial nerves were intact. Her strength was notable for weakness throughout but was symmetric.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1.  Metastatic melanoma with metastases to the liver, lung and brain. 2.  Hypertension. 3.  Hypercholesterolemia. 5.  Osteoarthritis. 6.  Bursitis. 7.  Cellulitis. 8.  Chronic renal insufficiency. 9.  Coronary artery disease. 10. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  As stated above, the patient will be discharged to home with [**Hospital 2241**] nursing care.  Home Hospice has been discussed with the family, and they would like to avail this possibility as the need arises.
