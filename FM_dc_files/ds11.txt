Now p/w 1wk h/o diarrhea worsened one day prior to admission, found to have wbcc 30 in ED, admitted [**4-19**] and started on both p.o. vanco and IV flagyl. Began to have brbpr on [**4-25**], on [**4-30**] had flex sigmoidoscopy showing pseudomembranes with recurrent c.diff vs. bowel ischemia as etiology. Then developed some sob/fluid overload and was started on lasix and neseritide gtt's. Had had some intermittent afib which was thought to be contributing to presumed diastolic dysfunction.

 Brief Hospital Course: 84 yo f w/ h/o CRI, htn, h/o nephrotic syndrome, w/ diarrhea, c.diff pos at rehab, failure to respond to flagyl, w/ elev wbc, and negative ct. A brief-problem based hospital course is outlined below.

1) presumed c.diff infxn- Admitted and started on p.o. vancomyin and IV metronidazole, w/ addition of levofloxacin for broad spectrum coverage given recent abd surgery. Cholestyramine was initially given for toxin binding. WBC was 30 on admission and trended down with ABX; however, C.diff toxin neg x5, so diagnosis remains presumptive.  C. diff B toxin was sent and was negative as well. She completed a 3 week course of PO vanco and IV flagyl antibiotics, which was completed on [**5-14**]. She subsequently remained afebrile without further diarrhea, and was able to tolerate PO's.

2) [**Name (NI) 1866**] Pt began having episodes of BRBPR on [**4-25**] with resultant slow HCT drop. GI and surgery were consulted. Pt had no abdominal pain, but given recent surgery and low albumin, we were concerned that the bleed may be evidence of ischemic bowel or dehiscence. Pt was also having intermittent episodes of tachycardia, raising the possibility that she was having embolic phenomena with acute ischemia. However, she had no abdominal pain to suggest this. Colonoscopy was done on [**4-30**], showing severe c dif vs. ischemic bowel. Surgery found that pt was not surgical candidate and believed her bleeding and mucosal damage was [**2-29**] c dif and would continue to improve. Biopsy results showed no evidence of c.dif, but given pt's tenuous status, po vanco and iv flagyl were continued while awaiting toxin B. It is quite possible that the mucosal changes seen on colonoscopy were the result of C dif infxn, which had been treated w/ABX and resolved, leaving the mucosae to heal. As well, GI felt there may be a superimposed ischemic insult. No further work-up was performed since she had good clinical resolution of her colitis, following completion of cdiff treatment.

2) acute renal failure w/ CRI-  Renal team was consulted on admisison.  Baseline cr is approx 2.0.  On admission this was significantly elevated to 4.1.  FENA was c/w prerenal etiology and patient had R IJ placed in ED, started on NS for volume resusciation.  This was undertaken slowly given that pt had an albumin of 1.4 and pleural effusions were noted on CT.  Fluids were changed to 1/2NS w/ bicarb on HD2. Cr trended down each day and the patient has maintained oxygenation.   Alb/cr ratio not c/w nephrotic range proteinuria- thus it was felt that the low alb was likely multifactorial. Pt initially required boluses of 500cc NS to maintain Uop ~20-30cc/hr. With hydration and improvement in her diarrhea, her Cr steadily decreased and returned to baseline of 1.6. She was seen by renal who felt that her increase in creatinine may have been secondary to ATN/hypotension and recommended avoiding aggressive overdiuresis. She did subsequently require aggressive diuresis given her rapid afib/chf with lasix and niseritide drips. However her creatinine remained at baseline of 1.7-2.0 with diuresis. She did develop a transient metabolic alkalosis, which was felt likely from volume contraction alkalosis. Therefore her lasix was weaned to 40mg daily and her bicarb trended back down to 30. Her creatinine was stable at 1.6 at the time of discharge.

3) [**Name (NI) 1867**] Pt was noted to be mildly thrombocytopenic on admisison.   Unclear why it was low when patient presented. Most likely [**2-29**] extreme inflammatory/SIRS response (given elev lactate on admission). Her PLT count dropped to 95 and DIC workup and HIT Ab were sent, both negative. Her PLT count rose as her clinical condition improved and remained in normal range for the duration of her hosital course.

4) HTN - Pt's baseline SBP is in the 180s-200s range. On admission, BP was low [**2-29**] 3rd spacing and early sepsis. Her BP responded to fluids and she remained relatively normotensive. She was continued on metoprolol for HR/BP control and isordil/hydral was added for afterload reduction.

5) CHF - Evidence of CHF on initial CXR. Her EF was found to be 40% (previously normal), bringing up concern for ischemic event precipitating her failure. In support of this she was noted to have wall motion abnormalities on ECHO with inferoseptal/basal hypokinesis. Diagnostic catheritization was not performed due to her renal insufficiency and decompensated CHF. She was managed medically, and on [**5-10**] the CHF service was consulted for management. She was initiated on aggressive diuresis with IV lasix for goal -1.5L per day. She was transferred to the CCU briefly on [**5-12**] for more tailored therapy and diuresis for her CHF (lasix boluses and nesiritide) with good effect (negative approximately 500 cc overnight). She was transferred back to the floor on lasix boluses.

Due to continued evidence of volume overload she was given 160mg IV [**Month/Year (2) 1868**] + started on lasix drip at 10mg/hr. Then started nesiritide [**Month/Year (2) 1868**] (1mcg/kg) followed by gtt at 0.01mcg/kg/min. Diuresed well to this and maintained BP well, however after increasing natrecor to 0.015, went back into rapid afib. Stopped natrecor on [**5-17**]. Stopped lasix gtt on [**5-18**] given persistent good diuresis. Now tapered down to 40mg daily lasix/day + afterload reduction w/ Isordil/Hydral on [**5-22**]. At the time of discharge, she was felt to be euvolemic with goal of matching ins and outs daily. We will continue her on this regimen upon discharge.

7.  Atrial fibrillation: Initially converted from RAF by medical cardioversion performed with procainamide gtt in the CCU at 13mg/kg/hr x10min load followed by 2mg/hr for 2h trial. Became hypotensive to 60's systolic, but subsequently recovered. Then again went into RAF on [**5-17**] early am. Initially HR controlled w/ IV lopressor/IV dilt. Then [**Hospital 1869**] medical cardioversion w/ procainamide. Became hypotensive to 70's systolic after about 10 minutes on procainamide [**Last Name (LF) 1868**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this was stopped and her blood pressures normalized. She then converted 10 min later to NSR. She has been in NSR the remainder of her hospital course. She is not on coumadin due to risk for bleed. In addition, amiodorone was discussed as a medical option for continued rythm control. However, given the side effect profile, the family and patient were more comfortable with holding off on adding amiodorone at this time. They understand that there is a higher risk of conversion back to atrial fibrillation and increased risk for stroke without amiodorone.  We will continue rate control with metoprolol as mentioned at 25mg TID, and may titrate up as needed to maintain HR <80.

8. CAD- wall motion abnormalities on ECHO w/ inferoseptal/basal HK. currently chest pain free. continuing with medical management. On statin/b-blocker. No plan for cath at this time given her renal insuff/co-morbiditites. Also holding off on aspirin currently given her bleed risk. This will be re-addressed as an outpatient through her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

9. Anemia- Initially had episode of GI bleed with blood loss anemia requiring 3 units of packed red blood cells. Hematocrit subsequently normalized. However, she subsequently was noted to have a low, but stable, hematocrit at 28-29. Repeat stool guaiacs were all negative and she had no further evidence of bleed or hemolysis. Iron stores were also found to be within normal limits, with low TIBC and high ferritin suggesting anemia of chronic disease. This was felt likely secondary to chronic renal insufficiency. She was started on EPO 2,000 Units q m,w,fr on [**5-22**]. The goal transfusion criteria would be 30 given her history of CAD, however, we have held off on further transfusion at this time given her known CHF with recent severe volume overload. We have set transfusion goal at hct>28, and transfused with 1 unit packed red blood cells and 20mg IV lasix for hct <28.

10. tachypnea- Resolved. Her transient tachypnea was felt likely secondary to volume overload. There was no evidence of infiltrate by CXR. Her ABG at the time on [**5-15**] showed 7.29/43/99. Her respiratory status subsequently improved that same day on [**5-15**] following IV lasix and atrovent nebulizers. Avoided albuterol nebulizers over concern for tachycardia.

11. F/E/N- Started on TPN for nutritional supplementation. She also had a swallow study which showed ability to tolerated regular solids and thin liquids. She has been taking in PO's as tolerated, but has continued to require TPN to reach nutritional goals. This will be continued upon discharge at rehab.
