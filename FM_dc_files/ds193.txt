 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old gentleman with a longstanding history of coronary artery disease.  He had an initial percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his left circumflex in [**2137**].  In [**2139**], he had a catheterization that showed 100 percent right coronary artery occlusion and a subtotal circumflex lesion with a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty done.  At the same time, he had a mild left anterior descending occlusion with some venous obstruction.

Over the past few months, he has had increasing angina with exertion.  On [**2152-1-11**], he had an exercise tolerance test that was positive with ST depressions with inferoposterior ischemia.  His angina is primarily between his scapula and back.  He was referred for cardiac catheterization which was done on [**2152-1-28**].  This revealed an ejection fraction of 60 percent.  He had a mildly dilated aortic root, right-dominant system, left main with a 20 percent occlusion, diagonal with 70 percent, ramus with 80 percent, circumflex with 95 percent, left anterior descending with 70 percent, with distal left anterior descending 90 percent occlusion, obtuse marginal with 80 occlusion, right coronary artery with 100 percent, and posterior descending artery with 70 percent.  No mitral regurgitation or aortic stenosis.  At that time, he was referred for bypass surgery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Glaucoma. 2. Tuberculosis. 3. Ventral hernia. 4. Question of lumbar stenosis. 5. Coronary artery disease (with percutaneous transluminal    coronary angioplasty in [**2137**] and [**2139**]). 6. Left-sided headaches (with question of temporal    arteritis). 7. Left carotid disease. 8. Diverticulitis. 9. Hypertension. 10.      Hiatal hernia with gastroesophageal reflux disease. 11.      Elevated cholesterol. 12.      Benign prostatic hypertrophy.

 PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1. Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy (as a child). 2. Colon polypectomy. 3. Bilateral laser eye surgery.

 ALLERGIES:  SULFA (causes hot flashes).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's height was 5 feet 9 inches tall, his weight was approximately 175 pounds, blood pressure in the left arm was 180/66, and his right arm blood pressure was 188/80.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a rate and rhythm.  Normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.  The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Left upper quadrant diverticula and ventral hernia.  Extremities were warm and well perfused.  There were no varicosities.  Good circulation, sensation, mobility. Pulse examination revealed right and left femoral were 2 plus, right and left dorsalis pedis pulses were 2 plus, right and left posterior tibialis were 2 plus, and right and left radial pulses were 2 plus.  Neurologically, the pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact.  A nonfocal examination.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the extraocular movements were intact. The sclerae were anicteric and not injected.  There were buccal mucosa.  Neck examination revealed there was no jugular venous distention.  There were no bruits.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON THE DAY OF DISCHARGE:  White blood cell count was 10.2, his hematocrit was 32.9, and his platelets were 349.  Potassium was 4.7, his blood urea nitrogen was 16, and his creatinine was 0.8.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Last chest x-ray revealed a small bilateral effusion.  No congestive heart failure.  No pneumothorax.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**3-23**] and underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times three.  He was extubated that afternoon.  He was initially A- paced at 80 with an underlying sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50.

On postoperative day three, he went into atrial flutter. After 5 mg of intravenous Lopressor, he had a nine second pause with conversion to a sinus rhythm.  That day, he had three subsequent pauses of about six seconds each, and the Electrophysiology Service was consulted.  On [**3-26**], he had some atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter with a rate in the 80s to 90s.

On the evening of [**3-27**], he went into an accelerated idioventricular rhythm and was subsequently A-paced at 80. He continued in a normal sinus rhythm with some episodes of accelerated idioventricular rhythm, but he was asymptomatic. On [**3-27**], the patient was started on 12.5 mg of by mouth Lopressor (per Electrophysiology).  They did not recommend a pacemaker or defibrillator placement.

The patient was transferred to the inpatient floor on [**3-29**]. His chest tubes had been removed on [**3-26**], and his cardiac pacing wires were removed on [**3-29**].  He had been followed throughout his hospital course by the Physical Therapy Service.  His chest tubes had come out on the [**3-26**].  The patient was cleared for home by the Physical Therapy Service on [**3-30**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Vital signs revealed his pulse was 65 (in a sinus rhythm), his blood pressure was 138/64, his respiratory rate was 18, and his oxygen saturation was  95 percent on room air.  His temperature maximum was 99.3 degrees Fahrenheit.  His weight on discharge was 79 kilograms.  Preoperatively 79 kilograms as well.  The patient was alert, awake, and oriented times three.  The sternal incision was clean, dry, and intact with a stable sternum. Bilateral lower extremity vein harvest sites were clean, dry, and intact with moderate ecchymosis on the right thigh. Cardiovascular examination revealed a rate and rhythm. Respiratory examination revealed the lungs sounds were clear. There were scattered rhonchi on the right side. Gastrointestinal examination revealed there were positive bowel sounds.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Extremity examination revealed some trace lower extremity edema.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home with Visiting Nurses Association on [**3-30**] in stable condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery    bypass graft times three. 2. Postoperative bradycardia. 3. Glaucoma. 4. Tuberculosis. 5. Status post induced right pneumothorax with scarring. 6. Hypertension. 7. Elevated cholesterol. 8. Benign prostatic hypertrophy.

 MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1. Metoprolol 25mg by mouth twice per day. 2. Lasix 20 mg by mouth once per day (times seven days). 3. Potassium chloride 20 mEq by mouth every day (times seven    days). 4. Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day. 5. Zantac 150 mg by mouth twice per day. 6. Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day. 7. Percocet 5/325-mg tablets one to two tablets by mouth    q.4h. as needed. 8. Lipitor 20 mg by mouth once per day. 9. Cozaar 25 mg by mouth once per day.
