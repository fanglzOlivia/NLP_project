History of Present Illness: 82yo Russian speaking F with a PMH of type II DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, obesity, pulmonary HTN and anemia, who presented to the ED this AM with worsening SOB x 2 weeks. Per the ED resident, the patient noted that she had had worsening SOB x 2 weeks (documented as 2 days [**Name8 (MD) **] RN note) and also complained of orthopnea and increasing lower extremity swelling and weeping from a venous stasis ulcer on her L shin. The patient was able to communicate this verbally to ER resident (RN notes she was only able to speak in 4 word sentences). Her VNA stated that she was only 94% on 2L O2 at home and had rales [**12-28**] way up bilaterally. On initial assessment in the [**Hospital1 18**] ER, her vital signs were T 98.2, BP 167/60, HR 61, RR 23, sats 100% on RA. On next assessment (2 hrs later), pt was felt to be very SOB while attempting to use the bed pan. RN noted her to be dusky, diaphoretic. HR 72, RR 28, sats 90% on RA. She was placed on a NRB with improvement in her O2 sats to 98%. BP rose to 210/74, then 215/93. CXR was taken and read as c/w pneumonia. Blood cx were obtained and ceftriaxone was administtered. 90 mins later, she was felt to be diaphoretic again, with increased work of breathing. Her O2 sats dropped to 90% by NRB and she was prepped for intubation. She was given 2mg versed and was intubated. SBP 210 -> 178 -> 130. She was taken to CT scan for CTA. On return from CT scan, she was felt to be bucking the vent. She was given fentanyl 100mcg, with resultant drop in her SBP to 77. She was then bolused 1L of NS with improvement in her SBP to 96. She was also given vecuronium 10mg IV and ativan 1mg IV because of inability to ventilate and biting at the tube. . On review, she was given: 1gm CTX IV x1, ? azithromcyin 500mg IV x1, lasix 20mg x1, 120mg succinylcholine IV, etomidate 20mg IV, 12.5mg versed IV, and fentanyl 100mcg x1.

Brief Hospital Course: 1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Most likely explanation is acute diastolic CHF ("flash" pulmonary edema) given acute onset and associated HTN.  No evidence of structural heart disease on echo. ? findings of PNA, and unclear what to make of other findings on CTA--lymphoma vs TB. Pt does have an elevated LDH, but it was felt these were unlikely possibilities.  Pt was treated for CHF with diuresis and improved.  She was extubated and respiratory status continued to improve fitting with CHF as the etiology.  She should have a repeat CT to evaluate the lymphadenopathy.  She was also empirically treated with pneumonia with azithro but she was afebrile with nml WBC.  She was continued on losartan, beta blockade. . 2) CV:  As above.  Continued on aspirin.  No evidence of acute ischemia. . 3) ANEMIA, iron deficiency: Baseline Hct 28-30, at baseline on discharge. On niferex as an outpatient. Iron studies checked at last visit--Fe/TIBC ~15%. Continued on iron for iron deficieny. . 4) HTN: Contine Metoprolol, [**Last Name (un) **] . 5) HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Continue home dose of lipitor. . 6) DM TYPE II: Placed on sliding scale insulin.
