 History of Present Illness: * interview conducted with the aid of Ms. [**Known lastname 1862**] daughter . History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 y/o F with history of nephrotic CRI, renal artery stenosis, and CHF, who presented with hypertensive emergency and heart failure. The patient reports that she was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission. At that time, her BP was 220 systolic @ home and she noticed mild SOB. On the night prior to admission, she developed increasing SOB. Per the patient's daughter, she had been taking her medications as prescribed. She denies chest pain throughout this time. She was brought in by daughter to [**Name (NI) **] for evaluation and was found to have BP 202/40 with a K of 5.9. She was treated with kayexalate 30, lasix 40 IV, clonidine 0.3 mg PO X 1, and levoflox 750 mg IV x 1. . The patient was initially admitted to the floor, where she was found to have the following vitals: 98.3 226/68 68 90% 5LNC (mid 80s on 2LNC), 96% on face tent, RR > 40. As she was acutely dyspneic and in acute failure, she was given 100mg IV lasix and Diuril (on the advice of Renal consultants), w/ good effect-> UOP 350cc in ~1hour. She did not receive any nitrates or morphine at the time. On MICU evaluation was 99% on shovel mask, but still RR>40. Appeared comfortable, JVP ~9 cm. At that time, she denied HA, visual changes, CP, urinary changes, no abd pain, N/V/D. In the MICU, she was aggressively diuresed and placed on her usual blood pressure regimen. Overnight [**Date range (1) 1873**], she did not receive all of her blood pressures meds as her BPs were in the 110s/120s overnight. She did receive all doses of clonidine and hydralazine on [**5-9**]. . Her daughter tells me that her edema is less than usual, but that her right leg is chronically larger than the left. She has been using several pillows to sleep at home. She denies PND. She is not on supplemental O2 at home. Generally BP at home is 170s (per PCP 160s in office at baseline). . Pt was diagnosed with w/ RLL PNA by her PCP and tx [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/ levofloxacin X 10 days about 4 weeks ago. Since that time, the daughter has been living with the pt X 3 weeks. Her cough has persisted per the daughter, but the patient did improve greatly following antibiotics. . At the present time, the patient says she is comfortable. She denies chest pain. She continues to make adequate urine.

Pertinent Results: Studies: [**2194-5-8**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Moderate congestive heart failure, worse since the exam of one month ago. . [**2194-5-8**] ECHO: TTE Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). . There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. . There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal mitral stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] . The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. . There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-9-19**], borderline mitral stenosis is now evident. The mitral regurgitation, which is almost certainly underestimated on this study, is probably increased. . [**2194-5-11**] CXR TWO VIEWS: Comparison with the previous study done [**2194-5-9**]. There is interval improvement in interstitial pulmonary edema. The mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists. Streaky density at the lung bases is consistent with subsegmental atelectasis. There is a moderate right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion. An underlying right basilar consolidation cannot be excluded. The heart and mediastinal structures are unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 year old female with probable endstage renal failure not on HD, who presented with hypertensive emergency and congestive heart failure.  She was admitted to the medical floor but immediately was sent to the MICU for respiratory distress. There she was agressively diuresed and then returned to the medical floor. . * Hypertensive Emergency: Her HTN is likely secondary to her ESRD.  The elevated blood pressures caused flash pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure.  She was given blood pressure medications to help control her BP within the range of 130-160 as she probably is dependent on some hypertension for perfusion.  Her baseline BP is reportedly 160 at home.  Ultimately she was placed on clonidine 0.2 mg TID, hydralazine 100mg TID, norvasc 10mg qday, metoprolol 12.5mg TID, lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **]. . * ? SVT: During her initally presentation, she did have some runs of SVT noted on telemetry.  Once she was diuresed no further episodes were noted.  She was continued on metoprolol 12.5 mg TID for given episodes of ? SVT. . * Congestive Heart Failure: Likely from worsening renal failure and hypertensive urgency. She was agressively diuresed in the MICU with IV furosemide overnight and then with PO furosemide on the medical floor. She was also continued on hydralazine for afterload reduction. . * Renal Failure: A renal consult was obtained.  They felt that there was no acute needs for dialysis at present although they have been discussing starting HD with the patient and her family for a while now.  This discussion was continued throughout the admission and the patient and her family were resistent to starting.  They agreed to meet with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**] in the next two weeks to discuss getting a tunnelled cath and starting HD. Throughout admission, her electrolytes were monitored closely as she had boughts of hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia and acidosis.  These were controlled with standard measures. . * Hyperkalemia: Received Kayexalate in ED. Usually takes kayexalate twice a week as outpatient, so this was restarted as an inpatient. . * Anemia: Baseline Hct appears to be 29-33 and now 25. Iron 45, ferritin 149, TIBC 269 in [**3-5**]. Per renal recommendation, she was transfused 1 unit PRBC on [**2194-5-12**] without complications. . * Bacteremia: WBC count 10 on admission and down to 6.4 today. Has been afebrile but blood cultures showed 2/4 bottles with staph coag negative- likely contaminant. Before speciation returned, she was treated with vancomycin dosed by level. Once it was found to be coag negative staph, the vancomycin was discontinued. All subsequent surveillence cultures were negative. . * Code status: Full - discussed w/ patient's daughter. . * COMM: Dtr [**Name2 (NI) 1874**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1875**]; Son [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1876**]
