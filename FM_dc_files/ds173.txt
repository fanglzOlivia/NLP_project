Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 158**] Chief Complaint: Abd pain and N/V

 Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p right and left hemicolectomy

History of Present Illness: 60F with ESRD s/p deceased donor renal transplant, HTN, and diverticulitis who was initially admitted for worsening abdominal pain and N/V and now presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with hypotension after having a n ex-lap and bowel resection for a perforated cecum.  She has had approximately 3 episodes of diverticulitis in the past year which resolved with antibiotics.  She was planning to have an elective outpatient laparoscopic colectomy given her frequent flares.  Prior to this admission, she reportedly had intermittent [**10-3**] abdominal pain in the RLQ and LLQ and significant nausea and vomiting, she was unable to keep down any POs for 48 hours prior to admission.  This felt worse than her prior diverticulitis flares and she was admitted for observation, hydration, and antibiotics.  CT abd/pelvis at admission showed pericolonic stranding but no e/o diverticulitis.

Since admission to the surgery service, she was staretd on Cipro and Flagyl for the colitis seen on CT.  Her abdominal pain acutely worsened on [**5-12**] and she described feeling a "[**Doctor Last Name **]" in her abdomen.  A repeat CT abd/pelvis showed perforation at the cecum with free air present and extravasation of PO contrast into the peritoneum.  She was taken to the OR for a ex-lab where she was found to have a stricture in the signoid colon and a perforation in her cecum with spillage of stool in to the peritoneum.  She underwent a right and left colectomy, the transverse colon was left in place but is discontinusous.  Her abdomen was left open after the procedure.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of [**2114-5-12**] 8:07 PM Supine and decubitus view of the abdomen shows pneumoperitoneum,

not present on the abdomen CT [**5-11**], but detected on the chest radiograph performed concurrently and reported prior to review of this study. Retained contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**] in the cecum shows its diameter is 8 cm.  Proximal to it, the small bowel is moderately distended to a diameter of 28 mm.  A subsequent abdominal CT scan also available at the time of this review shows the effects of likely cecal perforation.

IMAGING: -[**5-12**] CT Abd: IMPRESSION: 1.  There is evidence of new bowel perforation at the level of the cecum, with evidence of new free air, free fluid, as well as extraluminal oral contrast surrounding the cecum.  Surgical consultation is recommended. 2.  Pericolonic stranding is again noted diffusely throughout the colon and greatest throughout the descending and sigmoid colon.  These findings are most consistent with diffuse colitis which has likely led to perforation. 3. New small bilateral pleural effusions

Cardiovascular Report ECG Study Date of [**2114-5-14**]  11:12:58 AM Sinus rhythm with low amplitude P waves. Low QRS voltage throughout. Delayed R wave transition. Diffuse non-specific T wave flattening. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2112-7-15**] the voltage is lower. P wave amplitude has decreased. Diffuse T wave flattening is present. Clinical correlation is suggested.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2114-5-15**] 3:19 AM No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Low endotracheal tube position.

Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1119**], a patient known to the colorectal surgery service, presented to the emergency department on [**2114-5-11**] with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. She was diagnosed with diverticulitis and she was evaluated by the acute care service in the emergency department and a plan was formulated with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] to admit the patient for abdominal exams, antibiotics and rehydration with plan to monitor and expedite surgical plans based on her medical history and sudden relapse of symptoms while on outpatient antibiotic therapy. Nephrology was consulted for advice related to immunosuppression medications and past renal transplant and followed the patient for the duration of her inpatient admission. On [**2114-5-12**] the patient was monitored closely. She was started on a clear liquid diet and was given a Dulcolax Supp x1 and had 2 bowel movements. She remained distended and was given a dose of milk of magnesia. The patient was improving when she had a sudden onset of abdominal pain. CT revealed extravasation of contrast and she was taken to the operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for exploratory laparotomy and two segmental colectomies, was left with open abdomen and disconnected and because of the difficult case and condition of bowel as described in the operative note, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit appropriate drains. On [**2114-5-14**] the patient returned to the operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] after stabilization in the ICU for washout, completion proctectomy and colectomy, ileostomy and closure of the abdomen with retention sutures and staples. The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and the course of ICU care is described below.

[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course per [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] resident: 60F with ESRD s/p deceased renal transplant in [**2095**] on immunosuppression, HTN and h/o diverticulitis who presented to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with hypotension after ex-lap with right/left hemicolectomy performed for cecal perforation and sigmoid stricture. . #Cecal perforation s/p colectomy:  The cause of her perforation was thought to be a sigmoid stricture which was found intraoperatively, likely related to her multiple episodes of diverticulitis.   She had a primary anastomosis and loop ileostomy. She was commenced on vanc/Zosyn for an 8 day course per surgery, and was maintained on a morphine PCA prn. She was intubated for the procedure, but was quickly and successfully weaned off of the vent prior to callout to the surgical floor. . # Hypertension ?????? Her initial hypotension resolved, and her home anti-hypertensives were recommenced due to her hx of HTN. . #ESRD s/p renal transplant: renal transplant recs were followed, and after her procedure, she was restarted on azathioprine, and transitioned to a 5mg daily dose of prednisone. She was restarted on cyclosporine per renal transplant on [**5-17**]. . #Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: Resolved. Likely related to volume resuscitation with NS. Chloride is also elevated which supports this. . #Anemia: Hct trending down almost 10 points compared to her pre-op CBC.  Likely from blood loss during her colectomy as well as dilutional effect from multiple fluid boluses.  She was also hemoconcentrated at admission from poor PO intake and has baseline anemia with Hct in the 24-32 range from her ESRD s/p transplant. She was transfused with packed red blood cells. She was monitored closely.

The patient was extubated and started on a clear liquid diet on [**2114-5-17**].

Surgical Floor Course:

The patient was transferred to the inpatient floor on [**2114-5-18**] and began a regular diet. She was continued on her antibiotic course. [**2114-5-19**] the Foley was removed at midnight. The patient had temporary central venous access which was not ideal for the floor and because of intravenous antibiotics and the patient's access status  unable to place PICC line after multiple attempts. IR was unable to schedule the patient for IR placement of the PICC line. The nursing staff continued to use the CVL for access. On [**2114-5-20**] the patient was voiding. She was given vancomycin 500x1, troughs were monitored closely at the patient was a renal transplant patient and she was strated on pain medications by mouth. [**2114-5-21**] Renal transplant fellow: recommend continuing home dose of immunosuppression medications. JP drains were removed. The patient was meeting discharge criteria. She was followed closely throughout her admission by the wound/ostomy nursing team as well as physical therapy. After consultation with the nephrology team the patient was started on a 14 day course of Augmentin started and fluconazole and Zosyn were discontinued. The PICC line was pulled back to midline position and the central venous line was removed without issue. Her cyclosporine trough was monitored closely throughout her hospitalization as there was a risk of interaction with fluconazole. Her last trough was 112 on [**2114-5-19**]. She continued her Cyclosporine and was discharged on appropriate dosing. The patient was ordered to have the Cyclosporine trough measured prior to the morning dose on [**2114-5-24**] and dose adjustment with assistance of the renal transplant center. Arrangements were arranged for the patient to be transferred to a rehabilitation facility appropriately as she had become deconditioned. The midline catheter was removed at time of discharge.

Unfortunately after this procedure you were found to have a stricture and leaking into your abdomen which required you to be taken back to the operating room for a completion colectomy and end ileostomy. Closure of the surgical incision required placement of retention sutures which remain in place and will stay in place along with the staples until you return for your 2 weeks post-operative visit. You have recovered from this procedure and you are now ready to return home. Samples from your colon were taken and this tissue has been sent to the pathology department for analysis. You will receive these pathology results at your follow-up appointment. If there is an urgent need for the surgeon to contact you regarding these results they will contact you before this time. You have tolerated a regular diet, passing gas and your pain is controlled with pain medications by mouth. You may return home to finish your recovery. It is important that you continue to have your immunosupression medications monitored for your kidney transplant. Please have your level checked at rehab the morning of [**2114-5-24**] and the goal of the cyclosporin level is 50-100. The rehab should fax this level to the renal transplant office after it is back for recommendations at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 697**]. This will be ordered in your paperwork however, it is the facilities responsibility to order the test.

Please monitor your bowel function closely. If you have any of the following symptoms please call the office for advice or go to the emergency room if severe: increasing abdominal distension, increasing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids, elevated ileostomy output. You have a new ileostomy. The most common complication from a new ileostomy placement is dehydration. The output from the stoma is stool from the small intestine and the water content is very high. The stool is no longer passing through the large intestine which is where the water from the stool is reabsorbed into the body and the stool becomes formed. You must measure your ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output from the stoma should not be more than 1200cc or less than 500cc. If you find that your output has become too much or too little, please call the office for advice. The office nurse or nurse practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the ileostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated, if you notice your ileostomy output increasing, take in more electrolyte drink such as Gatorade. Please monitor yourself for signs and symptoms of dehydration including: dizziness (especially upon standing), weakness, dry mouth, headache, or fatigue. If you notice these symptoms please call the office or return to the emergency room for evaluation if these symptoms are severe. You may eat a regular diet with your new ileostomy. However it is a good idea to avoid fatty or spicy foods and follow diet suggestions made to you by the ostomy nurses.

Please monitor the appearance of the ostomy and stoma and care for it as instructed by the wound/ostomy nurses. The stoma (intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) should be beefy red or pink, it may ooze small amounts of blood at times when touched and this should subside with time. The skin around the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the skin around the stoma for bulging or signs of infection listed above. Please care for the ostomy as you have been instructed by the wound/ostomy nurses. You will be able to make an appointment with the ostomy nurse in the clinic 7 days after surgery. You will have a visiting nurse at home for the next few weeks helping to monitor your ostomy until you are comfortable caring for it on your own. The bridge will be removed from the ileostomy at your follow-up appointment with the wound/ostomy nurses.

You have a long vertical incision on your abdomen that is closed with staples and retention sutures. This incision can be left open to air or covered with a dry sterile gauze dressing if the staples become irritated from clothing. The staples will stay in place until your first post-operative visit at which time they can be removed in the clinic, most likely by the office nurse. Please monitor the incision for signs and symptoms of infection including: increasing redness at the incision, opening of the incision, increased pain at the incision line, draining of white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if you develop a fever. Please call the office if you develop these symptoms or go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe. You may shower, let the warm water run over the incision line and pat the area dry with a towel, do not rub.

No heavy lifting for at least 6 weeks after surgery unless instructed otherwise by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. You may gradually increase your activity as tolerated but clear heavy exercise with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. You must continue to wear the abdomoinal binder with a whole cut for the ileostomy to fit under at least until your second post-operative visit with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. He will give you further instructions at this time.

You will be prescribed a small amount of the pain medication Please take this medication exactly as prescribed. You may take Tylenol as recommended for pain. Please do not take more than 4000mg of Tylenol daily. Do not drink alcohol while taking narcotic pain medication or Tylenol. Please do not drive a car while taking narcotic pain medication.
