#.  Abdominal pain:  Pt has epigastric and umbilical pain which he states occured after he noted withdrawal symptoms.  Lactate was normal, KUB was unremarkable, and CT abdomen/pelvis showed no source of abdominal pain.  The abdominal pain significantly improved on PPI, and is likely [**12-16**] alcoholic gastritis.  He does reportedly have a history of pancreatitis with normal lipase, and his epigastric pain radiated to back initially but the patient's pain improved with a PPI as mentioned above.  He was transitioned to a po PPI [**Hospital1 **] and started on Sucralfate and viscous Lidocaine with improvement of symptoms and was tolerating a regular full diet without difficulty.
