Date of Birth:  [**2126-9-17**]             Sex:   F

Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies: Haldol / Prozac / Paxil / Sinemet Cr

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1032**] Chief Complaint: FTT

 Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PEG placement

History of Present Illness: The pt is a 59 year-old right-handed with progressively worsening stiffness, weakness, and dysarthria since [**2183**] who is sent in from her rehab for generalized weakness , decline and difficulty eating. The patient is followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 951**] in the movement disorders division who notes an extensive negative workup in his most recent assessment of [**2186-1-10**] (see below). Per the record the stiffness started after a fall on ICE in [**2183**]. She was admitted 7/21-26/07 for left leg dystonia. Possible etiologies considered at that time included hereditary spastic paraparesis, Parkinsons, and multiple systems atrophy. Little evidence could be found for any of these disorders.

 An new EMG today demonstrated a generalized, moderately severe, chronic and ongoing disorder of motor neurons or their axons.

 The patient has been on tizanidine, flexeril, baclofen, sinemet, and artane - none with particularly significant effect.



Past Medical History: depression, rotator cuff injury, osteopenia, colectomy, appendectomy Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 1033**] [**2186-1-10**] note: "Extensive prior evaluations were summarized in my note from [**6-11**], [**2185**], including multiple brain and spine imaging studies that have failed to yield an explanation for her symptoms. She also was admitted. She has had negative HTLV 1 and 2 testing, negatively glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, negative spinal fluid analyses including absence of oligoclonal bands, normal ceruloplasmin, negative RPR, negative Lyme serology, negative [**Doctor First Name **], rheumatoid factor, and HIV test. EMG also was reported to be normal in 08/[**2185**]. She was admitted in [**2185-7-24**]

with increased mobility difficulties. The additional evaluation

did not reveal a clear etiology. They initiated a trial of tizanidine, and this may have helped somewhat. They also reduced

her Flexeril dose."

 Social History: Ms. [**Known lastname 1034**] currently is living at the [**Hospital 745**] Healthcare Center nursing home.

 Family History: Notable for arthritis of the spine in her father who also had limited use of one arm when he was older, but the specifics again are difficult to clarify. She also has a son with "arthrogryposis" who is in a wheelchair.

 Physical Exam: Vitals: T:98 P:96 R:18 BP:118/70 SaO2:95%RA General: Awake, cooperative, NAD. HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated. No nuchal rigidity

Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl. S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted. Extremities: edema in the lower extremities bilaterally, 2+ radial, pulses. Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.



Neurologic: -Mental Status: The patient regards the examiner and carries papers with sheets of words that she points to in order to communicate. She has another sheet with the alphabet on it that she uses to spell out her words. She is able to communicate this way however slowly. She indicated that she had heartburn. She follows commands. Her responses to yes/no questions were correct with vibration (versus not) of the tuning fork.



-Cranial Nerves: Olfaction not tested. PERRL 3 to 2mm and brisk. VFF to confrontation. There is no ptosis bilaterally. Funduscopic exam was limited as the patient kept blinking and turning away. EOMI without nystagmus. Normal saccades. Facial sensation intact to pinprick. No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric. Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally. Palate elevates symmetrically. 5/5 strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally. Tongue protrudes only minimally and is very slow from side to side.



-Motor: Right upper extremity more mobile than left. Right upper extremity is spastic. Left upper extremity is hypertonic and flexed. Bilaterally lower extremities are extended even at the ankle. They are extremely hypertonic. She can move both lower extremites, but only at the hips and then only minimally.



-Sensory: No deficits to light touch, pinprick, cold sensation, vibratory sense, proprioception throughout.



-Coordination: FNF was slow but smooth and accurate with the RUE.

 UA Negative for infection.



Radiologic Data: EMG:IMPRESSION: Abnormal study. The electrophysiologic findings are most consistent with a generalized, moderately severe, chronic and ongoing disorder of motor neurons or their axons. The findings do not support stiff-person syndrome or dystonia.

 CXR:IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process detected.

 LENI: NO DVT in LLE.

VIDEO SWALLOW: IMPRESSION: Intermittent aspiration with thin barium.

G-tube placement: IMPRESSION: Successful percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube placement. The tube is now ready for use.

PLAN: The T-fastener skin sutures (green-colored sutures) can be cut and released in [**8-3**] days (ON [**2-25**]).

 Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1034**] is a 59-year-old woman who was admitted for further evaluation of her chronic progressive movement disorder. Based on her exam, which with her progression by the time of this admission showed mixed upper and lower motor neuron signs, and based on her EMG on the day of admission showing motor neuron disease, she was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

1. ALS. She was set up to follow up in the [**Hospital **] clinic. After a pulmonology consult, it was seen that she did well with her respiratory status when sitting upright during the day, but has paradoxical breathing at night. She was transferred for one night to the ICU for BiPAP titration, and she should now use this at night.

2. Dysphagia. She passed a swallow eval, but was given a PEG for supplemental nutrition and with the expectation that her dysphagia will progress. She can take some nutrition by mouth and is getting tube feeds as in the discharge instructions. *** The T-fastener skin sutures (green-colored sutures) can be cut and released in [**8-3**] days (between [**2-25**] and [**2-28**]). ***

3. Spasticity. She was started on tizanidine (Zanaflex) and Flexeril for painful spasticity, and was given a Lidoderm patch for the pain. This did improve her, though she remains highly spastic.

4. Anxiety. Psychiatry was consulted for her anxiety and recommended Ativan as ordered (with caution for her respiratory status) and Buspar, in addition to continuing her Lexapro.

5. CODE STATUS: After length discussions with her, she decided to be a DNR/DNI.
