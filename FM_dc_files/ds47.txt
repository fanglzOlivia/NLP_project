Brief Hospital Course: 80 yo F w/ DM2, HTN, PA HTN p/w SOB and LE edema x1 week, now with severe anemia (hct of 17 noted by her PCP) thought to be secondary to UGIB, hemodynamically stable s/p 6 Units of bld w/ increase of hct to 30. serial hcts q 6 hrs remained stable at 30.

Pt had EGD in ED ([**2132-9-5**]) which revealed granularity, friability and erythema in the stomach body, fundus and antrum compatible with acute gastritis (biopsy obtained). Erythema in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis. Ulcer in the distal bulb. Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum.

Echo:([**2132-8-23**]) 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. 2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 5. Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2128-8-18**], there has been no significant change.

1. GIB with increased BUN, likely UGIB, however LGIB initially considered as well. Pt had 2 large bore IV's placed.  NG lavage was positive as well as stool guiacs. EGD as above. No active bleed noted however ulcer and gastritis likely source of anemia. Ulcer thought to be secondary to NSAID use vs H. pylori.  Will treat for H.Pylori if indicated. Pt will follow up with GI. ASA was held secondary to bleed.  Losartan was initially held, then restarted at half normal dose. NSAIDs were avoided. Initially given IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] which was then changed to po. Colonoscopy performed was reported to be normal.

2. Cardiac. EKG changes (NSR at 84, Nl axis and intervals, TWI III, TWI V1-V4). Pt was ruled out for MI with three sets of neg cardiac enzymes. She denied CP. ECG changes likely secondary to demand ischemia from severe anemia. She was initially monitored on tele with no events. An echo done on [**2132-8-23**], as above (LVEF>55%). SOB most likely due to discontinuation of lasix for one week in setting of diastolic CHF. Treated with 40 of lasix IV (held off on diuresis intially secondary to concern for GI bld).

3. Resp. CXR done on [**2132-9-5**] without overt evidence of CHF or pneumonia. Findings suggestive of pulmonary artery hypertension.  She required O2 supplementation during her stay and was noted to have RA sats in the 80's with ambulation likely secondary to PA HTN. She was sent home on supplemental O2. A Repeat cxr was suggestive of pulm congestion. Lasix given as above.

4. DM2. Initially bld sugars controlled with RISS, oral hyperglycemics were restarted prior to discharge.

5. Anemia secondary to gastritis and PUD, as well as Fe/Vit B12 def. She was transfused a total of 6 Units of PRBC's and her hct was monitored q 6 hrs. She was started on Vit B12 supplementation. She was continued on Niferex.
