 Surgeon: [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], M.D. [**MD Number(1) 1288**]

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis severe, mitral regurgitation moderate, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis severe, mitral regurgitation moderate, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension.

OPERATION: Case planned for an aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement, and coronary artery bypass graft, cancelled secondary to intraoperative carotid injury during left internal jugular vein Swan introducer placement by anesthesia.

PROCEDURE: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was to undergo a possible multivalve coronary artery bypass graft today. After anesthesia, the patient was having an left internal jugular vein Swan Ganz introducer catheter placed using the Seldinger technique by anesthesia. After confirmation of placing the wire into the superior vena cava they were unable to pass the dilator. Upon withdrawal of the dilator, brisk red blood was coming out the small skin incision that appeared to be pulsatile. Immediately direct pressure was applied and an intraoperative vascular surgery consult was obtained. It took approximately 25 to 30 minutes for pressure to achieve excellent hemostasis.

Intraoperative Duplex ultrasound of the carotid showed antegrade flow with a very small low flow left carotid to left internal jugular vein fistula. It was felt by the vascular surgeon that this would probably thrombose on its own and would be re-evaluated within the next day.

Given the nature of the injury and the patient being a vasculopath, we elected to obtain a neurology consult as well as attempt to wake the patient up. After reversal of the chemical paralysis and sedation, the patient did in fact move all of his extremity to command and perform complex tasks. The patient was therefore extubated and appeared to be neurologically intact.

At[**Last Name (STitle) 1289**]time the case was cancelled and the patient will be brought back to the intensive care unit for critical monitoring of all organ systems. Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was present and participated throughout all significant portions of his preoperative care.

Brief Hospital Course: Pt admitted on [**12-23**] he had been scheduled earlier however with central line placement there was the creation of an av fistula by anesthesis causing case to be delayed. General [**Doctor First Name **] eval was obtained for toxic goiter and combination of thyroid and CABG,/[**Doctor First Name 1291**] was planned, endocrine evaluation was obtained and recommendations were followed regarding calcium monitoring and supplementation. [**12-25**] CABGx3, [**Month/Year (2) 1291**]/ thyroidectomy performed and in post op period there was some concern over CVA, because of left hand weakness, Imaging and neurologic consultation revealed this to be a re-manifestation of an old stroke that resoved with time, , Pt was extubated [**12-26**] and started on Keppra for neurologic protection, MRI of brain was performed, in CU had ARF with elevation of creatinine, pt was subsequently reintubated Drips and natrecor were D/C'ed 112/29 pt was extubated and intermittently folowing commands, [**12-31**] thoracentisis was performed for effusion,, [**1-2**] wide complex tachycaria ensued,, Vent dependent Respiratory failure occurred, was intermittendly in a flutter in unit in earlyt [**Month (only) **] controlled with medications and evaluated by EPS and [**Last Name (un) 1292**] recommendations were followed. Finally [**1-16**] pt was extubated and failed multiple swallow studies, and pt was cathed on [**1-16**] for post void residual, Pt mental stutus cleared and no residul defecots occurred neurologically just chronic debilitation. Pt was re-evaluated for swallowing and again failed, pt developed LLL infiltrate, Pt had IR post pyloric tube placed [**1-10**] for feeding, and eventually had PEG placed [**1-20**]. and PICC placed [**1-21**]. Pt was screened for rehab and was D/C to rehad in stable condition
