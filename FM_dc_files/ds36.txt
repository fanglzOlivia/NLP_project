Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-12-6**], the findings are similar. . [**2143-11-25**].  EGD.

Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 2469**] is a 68 y.o. man with PMH significant for HTN and alcohol abuse, admitted for DOE and chest pressure. Patient was ruled out for MI, but developed coffee ground emesis while on heparin drip.  EGD showed severe esophagitis and gastritis. . Upper GI bleed.  Patient developed coffee-ground emesis in ED in setting of chronic heartburn and alcohol abuse while on heparin drip.   EGD showed severe esophagitis and gastritis, likely due to chronic alcohol use.  Hct fell to 32 from 42 on admission, but patient did not require transfusions.  He was sent home on PPI [**Hospital1 **]. Gastric biopsies for H. pylori were pending at time of discharge. . Chest pressure/ SOB.  Patient presented with CP and SOB on exertion.  He has no history of CAD.  He had a stress test one year ago which was terminated early due to hypertension. Cardiac enzymes were negative.  He was initally started on a heparin drip in the ED due to concern for unstable angina, but this was stopped when patient developed coffee ground emesis. His antihypertensives were intially held, but resumed on hospital day 2.  A lipid panel was checked and his LDL was in the 40s.  He was advised to get outpatient stress test and PFTs.  Patient has a significant smoking history and CSR showed hyperinflation, suggesting that his DOE may be pulmonary in origin. . Alcohol abuse.  Patient has history of alcoholism and quit drinking for 20 years and now drinks daily.  He denies history of DTs or seizure.  He was tremulous and required a CIWA scale. He was given thiamine, folate, and multivitamin during his hospitalization. . Transaminitis.  Patient had mildly elevated LFTs that were thought to be due to alcohol hepatitis.  Hepatitis serologies were sent, but were pending at time of discharge. . Contact: patient and his partner [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 2470**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2471**]
