 Service: MEDICINE

Allergies: Demerol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 983**] Chief Complaint: Lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none

 History of Present Illness: 82 year old male with past medical history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, BPH, chronic kidney disease and gout who presents with intermittent confusion and high fevers. The patient is [**First Name3 (LF) 595**] speaking only, generally sleepy but family (son) recounts that the patient had difficulty voiding 6/1-2/[**2150**]. At the time, he endorsed urinating frequently but small amounts each time (?frequency, urgency)He presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] and was found on urinalysis to have a UTI. He did not have any fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, flank pain at the time. He was discharged on Macrobid 100mg twice daily X 7 days. The patient has been taking the medication reliably but urine culture sensitivities/speciation today demonstrated Enterobacter aerogenes sensitive to a number of antibiotics, but resistant to macrobid. The patient's wife was [**Name (NI) 653**] by the [**Name (NI) **] QA via [**Name (NI) 595**] interpreter and Cipro 250mg tablets daily X 7 days was prescribed. . In the interim, the patient's son has been calling to check in on him and found him progressively lethargic, dizzy and intermittently unable to urinate. Today he slept throughout the day and had some urinary frequency/urgency in the morning that resolved this afternoon. He also developed high fevers (temperature not taken) with rigors/shakes. He was noted to have elevated blood sugars and lower blood pressures than normal. He usually runs SBP160-180s, per his son, without antihypertensives and SBP110-120s with them. This morning, he took all his medications and subsequently, his blood pressures have been in the SBP90s. The patient has taken in very little PO food/liquids since [**2151-5-21**]. He did take one tablet of the Cipro this afternoon and stated he felt somewhat better. . In the ED, initial VS: T100.8, HR96, BP111/46, RR20, O2 sat 97% on RA. He was given acetaminophen 650mg PR and ciprofloacin 400mg IV X1. His labs were notable for hyponatremia (132), Cr 1.4 (close to prior baseline), leukocytosis to 11.9 with left shift (no bands). His lactate was 1.6. He was also given IVF and did become less lethargic, more interactive with family. He did not urinate down in the ED to provide a repeat sample. . Upon transfer to the medical floor, vitals were T: 98.1 P: 88 BP: 103/45 RR: 25 SaO2: 95% on 2L NC (does not use oxygen at home).

IMAGING: [**2151-5-25**] NCHCT:  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or large acute territorial infarction.  The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is well preserved. There is mild age-related brain parenchymal atrophy with secondary mild dilatation of the ventricles.

The paranasal sinuses and mastoids are clear.  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.

IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial abnormality.

NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is significantly disproportionate lateral more than 3rd ventriculomegaly, compared to the degree of sulcal prominence; while this may simply represent preferential central atrophy, underlying communicating hydrocephalus is an additional consideration, and should be correlated clinically. [**2151-5-25**] CXR:  There is a right infrahilar and a right lung apex opacity, possibly representing multifocal PNA. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila are normal.  There is no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax. [**2151-5-25**] EKG:  Atrial fibrillation. Left axis deviation. Right bundle-branch block. Consider inferior myocardial infarction. Since the previous tracing of [**2145-5-31**], atrial fibrillation is new, axis is now more leftward, and QRS width is wider. Clinical correlation is suggested. Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 90 0 172 410/462 0 -86 23 [**2151-5-26**] CXR:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has unchanged focal parenchymal opacities in the right upper and right lower lobe.  In addition, however, there is an increase in size of the cardiac silhouette, increase in diameter of the pulmonary vessels and increase of the interstitial markings. Altogether, these findings suggest interval appearance of pulmonary edema. [**2151-5-26**] EKG:   Atrial fibrillation with a modestly controlled ventricular response. Left axis deviation. Right bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular block.  There are tiny R waves in the inferior leads consistent with possible myocardial infarction. Compared to tracing #1 atrial fibrillation has replaced by atrial tachycardia. Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 91 0 152 368/422 0 -77 56 [**2151-5-27**] CXR:  Right upper lobe consolidation is more conspicuous than before.  Right perihilar and lower lobe opacities have improved.  Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are unchanged. Right pleural effusion is stable.  There is improved pulmonary edema. There are no new lung abnormalities. [**2151-5-28**] ECHO:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls. The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No vegetations seen [**2151-5-29**] EKG:  Sinus rhythm. Prolonged P-R interval. Right bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular block. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2151-5-27**], the rhythm has changed. Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 83 [**Telephone/Fax (3) 985**]/434 66 -72 36







Brief Hospital Course: A/P:  89 yo w/ afib, LBBB and recurrent UTIs admitted with urospesis requiring MICU transfer, discharged home with a 2 week course of ciprofloxacin and home physical therapy. . ENTEROBACTER BACTERMIA AND SEPSIS:  Patient initially was seen in the emergency department approximatley 1 week prior to admission with a UTI, treated with macrobid.  The patient was subsquently [**Telephone/Fax (3) 653**] by the Emergency Department after culture results returned with a macrobid resistant enterobacter species and perscribed ciprofloxacin.  Approximately 2 days after starting ciprofloxacin, though it is unclear how many doses the patient took, he developed lethargy, confusion and fevers at home.  He was admitted to the medical service where he quickly triggered for hypotension and was not responsive to 4 L of fluid boluses.  He was broadened to Vanc/Cefepime and subsequently developed pulmonary edema in the setting of volume reusitation and was transfered to the MICU without requiring intubation. Blood cultures returned GNRs in [**3-24**] bottles later speciated as a pan-sensitive enterobacter similar to what was seen in the urine.  CXR showed a possible multifocal pneumonia as well. Infectious diseases was consulted and recommended treatment with ciprofloxacin for a 2 week course despite the patient's prolonged QTc from a prior intrafasicular block.  No inpatient urologic evaluation was felt indciated though his recurrent urinary tract infections and prior prostate operations did warrant further outpatient evaluation.  QTc at discharge was 444 ms. . # TROPONINEMIA:  Patient was noted to have an elevated troponin with a normal CK-MB fraction in the setting of septic shock and volume resusitation.  Given his coronary history and underlying LBBB perventing adequate evaluation of ischemic changes the patient underwent ECHO which showed a posterior/inferior hypokenesis.  Cardiololgy was consulted and felt this be related to demand and not an acute coronary process.  Patient was continued on home meds and scheduled for outpatient cardiology follow up. . # HTN: Patient's antihypertensives were initially held in the setting of sepsis.  His antihypertensives were gradually restarted but the patient was symptomatically hypotensive on his home regimen while working with phsyical therapy.  His amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide were therefore held and patient was able to maintain pressures in the 120s on valsartan 320 mg, lasix 40 and metoprolol XL 50 mg daily. . # Hyperlipidemia: Stable continued on home statin. . # Atrial fibrillation: Stable, was intermittently in sinus rhythm through out his stay.  Discharged on home metoprolol and pradaxa. . # Diabetes mellitus, type 2: Stable, home oral hypoglycemics were held in house in the setting of sepsis and patient maintained on an insulin sliding scale. . # Benigm prostatic hypertrophy: s/p TURP and generally stable though difficulty voiding and prior prostate instrumentation raises the risk for recurrent UTIs.  Patient was scheduled for outpatient urology follow up with his primary urologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 986**]. . # Gout: Stable, no signs or symptoms of a flare continued home allopurinol . ------------------ TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Discharge ECG QTc 444 ms [**Name13 (STitle) 987**] weight: 91 kg (inaccurate) -Discharge weight: 82.2 kg (181.4 lbs) -Patient is a full code -patient discharged to complete a 2 week course of ciprofloxacin -patient discharged with home PT -patient given prescription for bedside commode per family's request -NCHCT reports:  There is significantly disproportionate lateral more than 3rd ventriculomegaly, compared to the degree of sulcal prominence; while this may simply represent preferential central atrophy, underlying communicating hydrocephalus is an additional consideration, and should be correlated clinically.
