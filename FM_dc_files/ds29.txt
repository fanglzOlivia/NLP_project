Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Altered Mental Status and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None

History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **]F Russian-speaking h/o refractory nodular sclerosing Hodgkins Lymphoma was brought in by EMS and admitted after her home health care aide noted she was hypotensive to 88/40 and confused.

In the ED, T 98.4 (rectal), HR 101, BP 102/53, RR 20, O2Sat 98% on 3L. Incontinant of guaiac-positive stool.  Treated with 4 L NS, vanco 1g IV, ceftazadime 1g IV, and flagyl 500mg IV. Received 0.5 mg ativan and 2mg IV morphine for agitation.

Pt was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she completed a 10-day course of ceftazadime and vancomycin for urosepsis. A 7-day course of metronidazole was also completed for empiric treatment of C. Diff given loose stools in the setting of an elevated WBC count, although all C. Diff assays were negative. Pt was stabilized and was transferred to the floor for further care. At the time of transfer, active issues were poor nutritional status, thrombocytopenia and anemia.

On the floor, however, pt experienced an episode of new Afib with RVR to 160s and hypotension to SBP 90-100s, as well as respiratory distress after she received fluid resuscitation. There was also a concern for tachy-brady syndrome because she had pauses up to 4 sec on telemetry; EP curbside, however, felt digoxin was not recommended.

Pt was therefore readmitted to the MICU.  While in the MICU, she was started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam as she had (1) sites of possible infection at the erosions under her breasts and on her right hip, as well as question of PNA, (2) rising WBC, reaching a high of nearly 17.  MICU course was also marked by (1) hypotension, which responded to gentle NS boluses; (2) low UOP believed to be [**2-22**] both hypovolemia and a low baseline nitrogenous load/obligate urine output; and (3) recurrent Afib, for which she was transitioned to amiodarone 400mg PO daily, to run for 7 days before titrating downward.

Pertinent Results: [**1-8**] - CXR - IMPRESSION: Persistent right-sided effusion. No definite consolidation. Routine PA and lateral films are recommended for evaluation when feasible.

[**1-10**].  Echo. The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Based on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.

Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially admitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with hypotension and AFib with RVR.

# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with many family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the patient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU transfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the patient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**]. She was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a decision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.  Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**]. The family declined autopsy.

# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to 150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous conversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses and bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin considered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was started on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When the patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having increased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.

 # Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and thrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be secondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused total of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**]) with a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend platelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10. Transfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the patient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total of four units since [**2194-1-12**]).

# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having hypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to fluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV relaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for distributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was started on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was again hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary to systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a decision was then made to not escalate care.

# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious sources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions under breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz started on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not obtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff neg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.

# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since admission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been getting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have not been able to keep up her free water intake.

# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline on admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to infection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after resolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process. Thyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick euthyroid syndrome.

# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient developed labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for hypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide gtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated respiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a witnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While in the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had increasing O2 requirements.

# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on admission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of 0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due to sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was hypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought secondary to ATN.

# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg IV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home dose 1/4.

# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural effusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low albumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake. Diuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed above.  Continue to monitor.

# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis requiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were positive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast, which was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew out yeast.

# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right acetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan. There is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head secondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable destruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and surrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain is being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.

# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to agressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and hypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese in MICU due to development of hypotension in response to furosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**], unchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.

# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no interventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration causing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic count and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per oncology.

# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency. Encourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.
