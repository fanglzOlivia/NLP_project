RAPID PLASMA REAGIN TEST (Final [**2184-10-13**]): NONREACTIVE.

[**10-10**] CXR: There is no focal consolidation, and the lateral costophrenic foci are sharply delineated. Pulmonary vascular markings are normal. The heart size is at the upper limits of normal, and the mediastinum is otherwise unremarkable.

[**10-10**] EKG: Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Prolonged QTc interval. Prominent precordial  QRS voltage - consider left ventricular hypertrophy. Prominent lateral T waves of uncertain significance - could be within normal limits or early repolarization pattern. Clinical correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2173-11-9**], QTc interval is longer and early repolarization pattern less prominent.

[**10-12**] SKIN L BACK: Skin left back (A): Perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils consistent with dermal hypersensitivity reaction.  Note:  No intraepidermal neutrophils are seen on multiple levels. The results of a PAS stain will be reported in an addendum.

 Brief Hospital Course: 1) EtOH withdrawal:  EtOH neg on tox screen. Pt states he has baseline tremor ("shaky jakey" he calls himself), but it's not clear whether the hx of tremor might be due to episodes of Etoh withdrawl.  Valium given per CIWA scale.  His beta blocker and clonidine were continued.  Thiamine, folate, B12, and MVI were supplemented.  Urine and blood cultures were negative.  He exhibited sx of insomnia, tremulousness, anxiety, gastrointestinal upset, headache, diaphoresis, disorientation, tachycardia, hypertension, and agitation during this hospitalization.  He was still mildly disoriented when he signed out AMA on the last day of hospitalization.

2) Drug rash - Treated in the ER with SQ epinephrine, steroids, atarax, and zantac.  Biopsy was consisted with drug rash, likely secondary to ciprofloxacin.  He should be recorded as having an allergy to ciprofloxacin. His rash resolved.

3) FEN - He had low Ca, Mg, P04 on admission, which were repleted.

4) Gap acidosis: He had a gap acidosis on admission that resolved - likely alcoholic ketoacidosis +/- starvation.

5) Hematuria - The patient's foley was removed on [**10-15**], and he subsequently complained of hematuria.  A UA was ordered, however the patient signed out AMA shortly thereafter, before the UA could be obtained.

The patient was transfered to the floors on [**10-15**], and subsequently signed out against medical advice.
