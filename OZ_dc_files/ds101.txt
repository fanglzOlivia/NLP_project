Admission Date:  [**2109-3-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2109-4-3**]

 Service:  [**Hospital1 139**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fevers.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84-year-old female with a past medical history significant for Parkinson disease with associated [**Last Name (un) 309**] body dementia and a long history of tobacco abuse who was noted with fevers.

The patient was in her usual state of health until two weeks prior to admission when she developed rhinorrhea.  The patient and her daughter deny any other symptoms at that time.

However, on the evening of [**2109-3-12**] the patient reports that she developed pain in the right side of her neck.  The following day, she had a temperature to 101 with continued intermittent right-sided neck pain.  She was again febrile on the morning of admission and called her primary care physician for his advise.  He suggested that she report to the Emergency Department for further evaluation.

In the Emergency Department, the patient's vital signs revealed a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit, her heart rate was 75, her blood pressure was 93/46, her respiratory rate was 18, and her oxygen saturation was 96% on room air.

A chest x-ray in the Emergency Department showed consistent cardiomegaly.  An opacity in the right lower lobe with probable right pleural effusion was identified.  There was no pneumothorax.  The patient was started on levofloxacin for a presumed community-acquired pneumonia.  Blood cultures were obtained.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On review of systems, the patient reports that she has "usual" cough productive of scant white sputum. She has had no recent dental work.  The patient denies ear pain, tooth pain, sores in her mouth, a sore throat, shortness of breath, chest pain, and diarrhea.  The patient does report overall weakness for the last one and a half prior to admission.  The patient denies sick contacts.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  Within the first few days of her admission, the patient was treated with levofloxacin for a presumed community-acquired pneumonia.  However, despite antibiotic treatment, the patient's white blood cell count remained elevated in the low 20s.  It did trend down slightly during this time period.

Throughout the first few days of her admission, the patient denied any shortness of breath and had an oxygen saturation in the mid 90s on room air.

On [**2109-3-18**], a posterior/anterior and lateral chest x-ray was obtained to re-evaluate the patient's presumed pneumonia.  In comparison to the admission film, the right lower lobe opacity had increased in size and intensity. There was a probable right pleural effusion.  There was also slightly more prominent pulmonary vessels on the right which were considered to be positional.  The left lung was relatively clear at that time with minor atelectasis at the base.

The following day (on [**2109-3-19**]), a chest computed tomography was obtained to better visualize the patient's lungs.  This showed a right loculated pleural effusion with parietal pleural enhancement and several small gas reflections.  In addition, there was right lower lobe atelectasis and consolidation and left upper lobe ground-glass opacities consistent with a second infectious process.

At this time, a Pulmonary Service consultation was obtained. Antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and ceftazidime.  The patient was taken to Interventional Pulmonary for placement of a chest tube on the right to drain the loculated effusion. Following placement of the chest tube, the patient had a small amount of hemoptysis in Interventional Pulmonology.  In addition, her oxygen saturation dropped to 88% on 3 liters via nasal cannula.  The patient was placed on 100% nonrebreather with an increase in oxygen saturations to 96%. At that time, the patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further care.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient's oxygen requirement rapidly decreased.  However, the chest tube did not drain the pleural fluid as expected.  It was found to not be in a sufficient pocket of pleural fluid.  Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted, but the patient and her family wished to avoid surgery at that time.

Therefore, on [**2109-3-22**], the patient was called out to the floor for further treatment with antibiotics.  Her chest tube was removed.  The patient was treated broadly with ceftazidime, vancomycin, and metronidazole.

A long discussion was held with the patient and her family regarding the slim possibility of cure of her loculated infection with antibiotics alone.  However, they continued to desire to avoid invasive procedures.  They were willing for a pigtail catheter to be placed in Interventional Radiology to see if it could drain some of her pleural effusion, and this was done on [**2109-3-23**].  Fluid continued to drain from the pigtail catheter over the next several days.  During this time, the patient's white blood cell count remained elevated but she was afebrile and had good oxygen saturations on room air.

However, despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and drainage from the pigtail catheter, the patient's white blood cell count was still significantly elevated on [**2109-3-28**] at 22,000.  At that time, the family spoke to the Cardiac Surgery and decided to proceed with a video-assisted thoracic surgery.  The patient underwent the video-assisted thoracic surgery procedure on [**2109-3-29**].  Following the procedure, she was initially extubated.  However, in the Recovery Unit, the patient developed hypotension to a systolic blood pressure in the 70s requiring treatment with Neo-Synephrine, acute respiratory distress with desaturations to the low 90s on face mask, and was eventually reintubated and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.

The patient was successfully extubated in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the next day (on [**2109-3-31**]).  The patient was returned to the General Medical floor later that day and has done well since that time.  At the time of this dictation, the patient was saturating in the mid to high 90s on room air.  In addition, her white blood cell count continued to decrease following the video-assisted thoracic surgery procedure.  On [**2109-4-2**] her white blood cell count was 11.5.  Her chest tube was removed on [**2109-4-1**] without difficulty.

An infectious and cytologic workup had been pursued on the fluid drained through the chest tube and pigtail catheter. In addition, specimens were sent during the video-assisted thoracic surgery procedure.  At the time of this dictation, the fluid obtained on [**2109-3-22**] grew scant gram-positive rods.  All other cultures have been negative to date.  Cytology specimens were negative for malignant cells. Final report of pleural tissue pathology was still pending.

2.  NECK PAIN ISSUES:  A wide differential was considered on admission for the patient's right-sided neck pain.  The patient had the neck pain only she was spiking fevers.  It was not reproducible on examination.

Two days into the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, her neck pain resolved spontaneously and has not returned.

3.  HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  On admission, the patient was continued on her home dose of lisinopril with good blood pressure control.  Following the video-assisted thoracic surgery procedure, the patient became hypotensive in the Recovery Unit and required pressors.  However, her blood pressure quickly returned to a normal range.  She was re-initiated on lisinopril 5 mg by mouth once per day on [**2109-4-2**].

4.  DEPRESSION ISSUES:  The patient was continued on sertraline throughout her hospital course.

5.  PARKINSON DISEASE WITH [**Last Name (un) **] BODY DEMENTIA ISSUES:  This was stable throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course.  The patient does not take any medications for this condition.

6.  REHABILITATION ISSUES:  Physical Therapy worked with the patient as tolerated during her admission.

7.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on a low-sodium diet.  Her potassium and magnesium were repleted as needed.

8.  PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on subcutaneous heparin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. Pantoprazole for gastrointestinal prophylaxis.  Senna and Colace for a bowel regimen.  The patient was placed on a nicotine patch during her admission to avoid withdrawal given her long smoking history.

9.  CODE STATUS ISSUES:  At this time, the patient is do not resuscitate/do not intubate.  Her family is very involved in the medical decision making.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was to be discharged to [**Hospital6 310**].  She is currently saturating in the mid 90s on room air.  She was afebrile, and her white blood cell count was trending down.  The patient reported that she felt well.
