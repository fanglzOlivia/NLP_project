Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 349**] is an 89 year old man who presented with several months of dizziness, thirst, and increased urination and was found to be hyponatremic with a sodium of 114 on admission. . # Hyponatremia: The patient was treated for hyponatremia with 3% saline solution in the Medical Intensive Care Unit. Per the renal consult team recommendations, the patient was placed on free water restriction to 1L per day and 3% saline was infused at 40cc/hr via PICC, with a goal of increasing the serum sodium by [**1-13**] mEq/hour or <12 mEq/24 hrs. Over this initial 24 hours of admission the patient's serum sodium increased from 114 to 119. On day 3 of admission 3% saline solution was discontinued and the patient was transfered to the floor. The nephrology team that was consulted initially continued to follow the patient during this admission and determined that the hyponatremia was hctz-induced. The patient's serum sodium normalized with the withdrawal of hctz and an SIADH work-up was not pursued, per renal recommendations. . # Word-finding difficulty: On initial presentation the patient experienced some word-finding difficulty that resolved as his serum sodium normalized. CT of the head was negative on admission. On discharge the patient was able to converse fluently without any word-finding abnormalities. The patient will follow up with his outpatient neurologist. . # Anemia: During this hospitalization the patient's hematocrit remained stable at 35. Iron studies did not reveal iron-deficiency anemia and the patient was guaiac negative on fecal occult blood test. The patient will have outpatient follow up of his anemia. . # Home Safety: The patient met with social worker who offered additional support services which patient declined.
